# Feature: Implement Purchase and Payout Verification Flow

## Issue Description

Our platform needs a secure and reliable purchase and payout flow that verifies all necessary conditions before allowing transactions. This flow should ensure that:
1. Users are properly authenticated before making purchases
2. Sellers have completed Stripe Connect onboarding
3. Payments are correctly processed and distributed between the platform and sellers
4. All transactions are properly recorded and can be audited

## Implementation Steps

1. Implement authentication gate for purchase actions
2. Add Stripe Connect verification for sellers
3. Create purchase flow with proper error handling
4. Implement payout distribution system (platform fee + seller payout)
5. Add transaction logging and receipt generation
6. Implement webhook handling for payment status updates

## Expected Behavior

- Users must be authenticated to initiate purchases
- Sellers must have completed Stripe Connect onboarding to receive payments
- Platform should receive its fee percentage from each transaction
- Sellers should receive their portion of each transaction
- All parties should receive appropriate notifications and receipts
- Failed transactions should be properly handled with clear error messages

## Technical Analysis

The purchase and payout flow requires integration between our authentication system, Stripe Connect, and our database:

1. Authentication verification must occur before any purchase attempt
2. Stripe Connect status must be verified for sellers before listing their content for sale
3. Payment processing must handle the split between platform fees and seller payouts
4. Transaction records must be maintained for accounting and user history

## Potential Implementation Approach

1. Authentication and Seller Verification:
   - Create middleware to verify user authentication status
   - Implement Stripe Connect status checking for sellers
   - Add UI indicators for incomplete seller onboarding

2. Purchase Flow:
   - Create a secure checkout process using Stripe Checkout or Payment Elements
   - Implement proper error handling for payment failures
   - Add purchase confirmation and receipt generation

3. Payout System:
   - Configure Stripe Connect for automatic fee splitting
   - Implement payout scheduling and status tracking
   - Create seller dashboard for payout history

4. Monitoring and Reporting:
   - Add transaction logging to database
   - Create admin dashboard for transaction monitoring
   - Implement reporting for financial reconciliation

## Likely Affected Files

1. `app/components/ui/lesson-access-gate.tsx` - Update to enforce authentication
2. `app/services/stripe.ts` - Add Connect verification and payout handling
3. `app/components/ui/stripe-connect-button.tsx` - Update for better onboarding status
4. `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Add transaction history and payout information
5. `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` - Handle payment and payout event webhooks
6. `app/components/ui/purchase-button.tsx` - Create new component for purchase flow

## Testing Requirements

- Test purchase flow with authenticated and unauthenticated users
- Verify Stripe Connect onboarding and verification process
- Test payment processing with various payment methods
- Verify correct fee splitting between platform and sellers
- Test webhook handling for various payment scenarios
- Verify transaction records are properly created
- Test across multiple browsers and devices

## Environment

- **Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Environment**: Development, Staging, Production
- **Payment Provider**: Stripe Connect (v2025-01-27.acacia)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth

## Priority

High - The purchase and payout flow is critical for platform monetization and seller satisfaction.

## Additional Context

- Platform fee is configured at 15% of transaction value
- Stripe Connect account type is 'standard'
- Payouts should be processed automatically after payment completion
- Consider implementing dispute handling and refund processes
- Documentation for both users and sellers on the payment process will be needed
- Consider implementing a sandbox mode for testing without real transactions
