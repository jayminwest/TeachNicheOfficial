# Feature: Setup Essential E2E Testing Pipelines

## Issue Description

Our platform requires comprehensive end-to-end (E2E) testing pipelines to ensure reliability and quality before launch. According to our launch plan, we currently have only 26.49% test coverage (target: >80%), with many critical components having 0% coverage. We need to establish robust E2E testing pipelines that:

1. Automate testing of critical user journeys
2. Verify core functionality across different browsers and devices
3. Integrate with our CI/CD workflow
4. Provide consistent and reliable test results
5. Help identify regressions before they reach production

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up Playwright test configuration for multiple browsers
2. Create baseline E2E tests for critical user journeys
3. Implement test fixtures for authentication and data setup
4. Configure CI pipeline integration
5. Add visual regression testing
6. Implement test reporting and monitoring
7. Document testing standards and practices

## Expected Behavior

- E2E tests should run automatically on pull requests
- Tests should cover all critical user journeys
- Tests should run across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Visual regression tests should catch unexpected UI changes
- Test reports should be easily accessible and understandable
- Failed tests should block deployment to production
- Tests should be reliable with minimal flakiness

## Technical Analysis

The E2E testing pipeline requires integration between Playwright, our CI system, and our application:

1. Playwright configuration must support multiple browsers and device profiles
2. Test fixtures must handle authentication, data setup, and cleanup
3. CI integration must ensure tests run efficiently without blocking development
4. Visual regression testing must have a baseline and comparison mechanism
5. Test reporting must provide actionable insights on failures

## Potential Implementation Approach

1. Playwright Configuration:
   - Set up browser configurations for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Configure mobile device emulation
   - Set up test parallelization for faster execution
   - Implement retry logic for flaky tests

2. Critical User Journey Tests:
   - Authentication flows (sign up, sign in, password reset)
   - Content browsing and discovery
   - Lesson purchase and access
   - Creator content upload and management
   - Payment processing and verification
   - User profile management

3. Test Infrastructure:
   - Create reusable test fixtures for common operations
   - Implement test data generation and cleanup
   - Set up isolated test environments
   - Configure screenshot and video capture for failures

4. CI Integration:
   - Configure GitHub Actions workflow for E2E tests
   - Set up caching for faster test execution
   - Implement test splitting for parallel execution
   - Configure failure notifications

5. Reporting and Monitoring:
   - Set up test result dashboards
   - Implement test analytics to track flakiness
   - Configure alerting for test failures
   - Create visual regression comparison tools

## Likely Affected Files

1. `e2e-tests/` - Create or update test files for critical user journeys
2. `playwright.config.ts` - Configure Playwright settings
3. `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml` - Set up CI workflow
4. `e2e-tests/fixtures/` - Create test fixtures
5. `e2e-tests/utils/` - Add test utilities
6. `package.json` - Add test scripts and dependencies
7. `ai_docs/standards/TESTING.md` - Document testing standards

## Testing Requirements

- Verify tests run successfully across all target browsers
- Ensure tests are reliable and not flaky
- Confirm CI integration works as expected
- Verify visual regression testing catches UI changes
- Test authentication flows with different user types
- Verify data setup and cleanup works correctly
- Test reporting provides clear insights on failures

## Environment

- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Devices**: Desktop, Tablet, Mobile
- **CI System**: GitHub Actions
- **Testing Framework**: Playwright
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth

## Priority

High - Comprehensive E2E testing is critical for ensuring platform reliability and quality before launch, especially given our current low test coverage.

## Additional Context

- Current test coverage is only 26.49% (target: >80%)
- Many critical components have 0% coverage
- Priority areas for testing include:
  - Authentication services
  - Video components
  - API routes
  - Payment processing
  - Lesson access controls
- Consider implementing a test-driven development approach for new features
- Documentation for writing and maintaining tests will be needed
- Consider setting up a visual testing service for UI regression testing
