# Documentation Migration Plan

## Purpose

This document outlines the plan for migrating from the current documentation structure to the new, improved structure. The migration will be conducted in phases to minimize disruption while improving organization and usability.

## Current Structure

```
ai_docs/
├── CORE.md
├── DEVELOPER_GUIDELINES.md
├── EXTERNAL_RESOURCES.md
├── HOW_TO_USE.md
├── ISSUE_REPORT.md
├── LAUNCH_PLAN.md
├── branch_guides/
├── checks/
├── issue_reports/
├── misc/
├── planning.md
├── prompts/
├── scratchpad.md
├── standards/
└── workflows/
```

## Target Structure

```
ai_docs/
├── core/
├── guides/
├── standards/
├── processes/
├── reference/
└── templates/
```

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

1. Create the new directory structure
2. Develop core templates and standards
3. Create the DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md guide
4. Establish documentation standards

**Deliverables:**
- New directory structure
- Documentation templates
- Documentation standards
- Migration plan (this document)

### Phase 2: Core Content Migration (Week 2)

1. Migrate high-priority documents:
   - DEVELOPER_GUIDELINES.md → core/OVERVIEW.md
   - standards/* → standards/*/
   - workflows/* → processes/*/

2. Update internal references and links

**Deliverables:**
- Core documentation
- Updated standards documentation
- Initial process documentation

### Phase 3: Guides and Reference (Week 3)

1. Create comprehensive guides based on existing content
2. Develop reference documentation
3. Migrate issue reports to appropriate locations

**Deliverables:**
- Development guides
- Deployment guides
- Maintenance guides
- API reference documentation
- Data model documentation

### Phase 4: Templates and Processes (Week 4)

1. Finalize all templates
2. Document all key processes
3. Ensure all documentation follows the new standards

**Deliverables:**
- Complete set of templates
- Process documentation
- Documentation quality review

### Phase 5: Review and Refinement (Week 5)

1. Conduct comprehensive review of all documentation
2. Gather feedback from team members
3. Make refinements based on feedback
4. Archive obsolete documentation

**Deliverables:**
- Refined documentation
- Feedback summary
- Archive of obsolete documentation

## Content Mapping

| Current Document | New Location | Action |
|------------------|--------------|--------|
| CORE.md | core/OVERVIEW.md | Migrate and expand |
| DEVELOPER_GUIDELINES.md | core/GETTING_STARTED.md | Migrate and restructure |
| EXTERNAL_RESOURCES.md | reference/EXTERNAL_RESOURCES.md | Migrate |
| HOW_TO_USE.md | guides/USAGE.md | Migrate and expand |
| ISSUE_REPORT.md | templates/ISSUE_REPORT.md | Standardize format |
| LAUNCH_PLAN.md | processes/release/PLANNING.md | Migrate |
| branch_guides/* | processes/development/BRANCHING.md | Consolidate |
| checks/* | standards/testing/* | Reorganize |
| issue_reports/* | Varies by content | Distribute to appropriate sections |
| misc/* | Varies by content | Evaluate and place appropriately |
| planning.md | processes/planning/OVERVIEW.md | Migrate |
| prompts/* | guides/development/PROMPTS.md | Consolidate |
| standards/* | standards/* | Reorganize into subdirectories |
| workflows/* | processes/* | Reorganize into subdirectories |

## Implementation Approach

1. **Create in Parallel**: Build the new structure alongside the existing one
2. **Migrate Incrementally**: Move content in phases, starting with high-priority items
3. **Validate**: Ensure all links and references work in the new structure
4. **Redirect**: Create temporary redirects from old locations to new ones
5. **Archive**: Once migration is complete, archive the old structure

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Documentation Lead**: Oversee the migration process
- **Content Owners**: Migrate and update their respective documentation
- **Reviewers**: Validate migrated content for accuracy and completeness
- **Technical Writer**: Ensure consistency and quality across all documentation

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. All valuable content has been migrated to the new structure
2. All documentation follows the new standards
3. Team members can easily find and use the documentation
4. Feedback indicates improved usability and clarity
5. The old structure has been properly archived

## Timeline

| Phase | Start Date | End Date | Key Milestone |
|-------|------------|----------|---------------|
| Phase 1 | [Start Date] | [End Date] | New structure established |
| Phase 2 | [Start Date] | [End Date] | Core content migrated |
| Phase 3 | [Start Date] | [End Date] | Guides and references complete |
| Phase 4 | [Start Date] | [End Date] | Templates and processes complete |
| Phase 5 | [Start Date] | [End Date] | Final review complete |

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Content loss during migration | High | Low | Create backups before migration |
| Broken links | Medium | Medium | Use automated link checkers |
| Inconsistent formatting | Medium | Medium | Apply templates and standards |
| Team resistance to new structure | High | Medium | Communicate benefits and provide training |
| Incomplete migration | High | Low | Track progress with checklist |
