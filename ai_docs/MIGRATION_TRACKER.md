| branch_guides/* | processes/development/BRANCHING.md | Not Started | | |
| checks/* | standards/testing/* | Not Started | | |
| issue_reports/* | Various | Not Started | | |
| misc/* | Various | Not Started | | |

## Implementation Approach

1. **Create in Parallel**: Build the new structure alongside the existing one
2. **Migrate Incrementally**: Move content in phases, starting with high-priority items
3. **Validate**: Ensure all links and references work in the new structure
4. **Redirect**: Create temporary redirects from old locations to new ones
5. **Archive**: Once migration is complete, archive the old structure

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Documentation Lead**: Oversee the migration process
- **Content Owners**: Migrate and update their respective documentation
- **Reviewers**: Validate migrated content for accuracy and completeness
- **Technical Writer**: Ensure consistency and quality across all documentation

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. All valuable content has been migrated to the new structure
2. All documentation follows the new standards
3. Team members can easily find and use the documentation
4. Feedback indicates improved usability and clarity
5. The old structure has been properly archived

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Content loss during migration | High | Low | Create backups before migration |
| Broken links | Medium | Medium | Use automated link checkers |
| Inconsistent formatting | Medium | Medium | Apply templates and standards |
| Team resistance to new structure | High | Medium | Communicate benefits and provide training |
| Incomplete migration | High | Low | Track progress with checklist |

## Notes and Challenges

- Initial setup of directory structure completed on 2025-02-24, ahead of schedule
- Need to coordinate with team leads for content review process
