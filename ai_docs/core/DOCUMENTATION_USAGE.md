# Documentation Usage Guide for Aider

This guide outlines how to effectively use project documentation with Aider.

## Finding Documentation

Aider can locate and use documentation as needed based on the current task:

```
When working on a task, follow these steps:

1. IDENTIFY the type of task you're working on:
   - Feature development
   - Bug fix
   - Refactoring
   - Documentation update

2. REQUEST relevant documentation:
   - Ask: "Can you show me documentation about [specific topic]?"
   - Example: "Can you show me documentation about API principles?"

3. REFERENCE specific sections:
   - For standards: "What are our standards for [specific area]?"
   - For processes: "What's our process for [specific workflow]?"

4. APPLY documentation appropriately:
   - Follow established patterns
   - Adhere to coding standards
   - Maintain documentation format
```

## Documentation Structure

Our documentation is organized into these key areas:

- **Core** (`ai_docs/core/`): Fundamental project information
- **Standards** (`ai_docs/standards/`): Code, testing, and documentation standards
- **Guides** (`ai_docs/guides/`): How-to instructions for common tasks
- **Reference** (`ai_docs/reference/`): Detailed technical information
- **Templates** (`ai_docs/templates/`): Standard formats for documentation

## When to Request Documentation

Request documentation when:
- Starting work in an unfamiliar area
- Implementing a new feature
- Fixing a complex bug
- Ensuring compliance with project standards
- Needing clarification on project architecture

## Documentation-First Approach

For complex tasks:
1. First, understand relevant documentation
2. Plan changes according to established patterns
3. Implement following documented standards
4. Update documentation if necessary

This approach allows Aider to discover and apply the appropriate documentation based on the specific context of each task, without overwhelming it with unnecessary information upfront.
