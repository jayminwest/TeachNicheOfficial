# Glossary

This document defines key terminology used throughout the Teach Niche platform and documentation.

## A

### Access Control
The system that manages permissions and restrictions for users accessing different parts of the platform.

### Analytics
Data collection and analysis of user behavior, content performance, and business metrics.

### API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of defined rules that allow different applications to communicate with each other.

## B

### Backend
The server-side of the application that handles data processing, business logic, and database operations.

### Billing Cycle
The recurring period for subscription payments (monthly, annually, etc.).

## C

### CDN (Content Delivery Network)
A distributed network of servers that delivers content to users based on their geographic location.

### Creator
A user who creates and publishes educational content on the platform.

### Conversion Rate
The percentage of users who complete a desired action (e.g., sign up, purchase).

## D

### Dashboard
The interface where users manage their account, content, and view analytics.

### Database
The structured storage system that holds all persistent data for the application.

## E

### E2E Testing
End-to-End testing that verifies complete user journeys through the application using Playwright. Our E2E tests should start with basic user flows and progressively include tests that interact with actual third-party APIs (Stripe, Supabase, etc.) to verify correct implementation and integration.

### Earnings
The revenue generated by a creator's content after the platform fee has been deducted, tracked in the system before being paid out.

### Engagement
Metrics that measure how users interact with content (views, completion rate, etc.).

### Environment
A specific instance of the application (development, staging, production).

## F

### Frontend
The client-side of the application that users interact with directly.

### Feature Flag
A technique that allows features to be enabled or disabled without deploying new code.

## L

### Learner
A user who consumes educational content on the platform.

### Lesson
A single unit of educational content, typically a video with supporting materials.

## M

### Metadata
Descriptive information about content (title, description, tags, etc.).

### Monetization
The process of generating revenue from content.

## P

### Payout
The transfer of earnings from the platform to a creator based on the platform's payout schedule.

### Platform Fee
The percentage (15%) that the platform charges for each transaction as the merchant of record.

### Merchant of Record (MoR)
The entity (Teach Niche) legally responsible for collecting payment from customers, handling taxes, and distributing earnings to creators (85% of lesson price).

### Processing Fee
The fee charged by payment processors (Stripe) that is passed on to buyers in addition to the base lesson price.

### Playwright
An end-to-end testing framework used to automate browser testing across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

## R

### Retention
The ability to keep users engaged and returning to the platform over time.

### Role
A set of permissions assigned to users based on their function (admin, creator, learner).

## S

### SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
A technique where pages are rendered on the server before being sent to the client.

### Subscription
A recurring payment model where users pay regularly for access to content.

## T

### TDD (Test-Driven Development)
A software development approach where tests are written before the code implementation. This is the required development methodology for all features and components in the Teach Niche platform. Tests should start with basic functionality and progressively include tests that verify correct integration with third-party APIs like Stripe and Supabase.

### Type Safety
The extent to which a programming language prevents type errors. In TypeScript, this means ensuring variables and functions use consistent types throughout the codebase.

### Transaction
A financial exchange between users and the platform or between users.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
An additional security layer requiring users to provide two forms of identification.

## U

### User Journey
The path a user takes through the platform, from discovery to conversion and beyond.

### UX (User Experience)

## V

### Video Encoding

### Viewport

## W

### Webhook
