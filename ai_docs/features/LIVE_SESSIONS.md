# Feature: Live Sessions with Players

## Description
Implement a new feature allowing users to book live, one-on-one sessions with kendama players. These sessions will be 15-30 minutes in length, can be either free or paid (at the player's discretion), and will be conducted via video call. All session recordings should be stored using our third-party video API, with payments processed through our existing Stripe integration.
