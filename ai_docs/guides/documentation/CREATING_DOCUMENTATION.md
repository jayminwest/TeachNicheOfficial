# Creating Documentation Guide

## Purpose

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating new documentation that adheres to our standards. Following this guide ensures consistency and quality across all project documentation.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the documentation repository
- Basic knowledge of Markdown
- Understanding of the project's documentation structure

## Step 1: Determine the Documentation Type

Identify which category your documentation belongs to:

- **Core**: Fundamental project information
- **Guides**: Step-by-step instructions
- **Standards**: Best practices and requirements
- **Processes**: Workflows for recurring activities
- **Reference**: Detailed technical information
- **Templates**: Standardized document formats

## Step 2: Choose the Appropriate Location

Place your document in the appropriate directory based on its type and subject matter:

```
ai_docs/
├── core/                # Core documentation
├── guides/              # Step-by-step instructions
│   ├── development/     # Development guides
│   ├── deployment/      # Deployment guides
│   └── maintenance/     # Maintenance guides
├── standards/           # Best practices and requirements
│   ├── code/            # Code standards
│   ├── testing/         # Testing standards
│   ├── security/        # Security standards
│   └── documentation/   # Documentation standards
├── processes/           # Workflow documentation
│   ├── onboarding/      # Onboarding processes
│   ├── incident/        # Incident management
│   └── release/         # Release processes
├── reference/           # Detailed technical information
│   ├── apis/            # API documentation
│   ├── data/            # Data documentation
│   └── infrastructure/  # Infrastructure documentation
└── templates/           # Documentation templates
```

## Step 3: Use the Appropriate Template

1. Navigate to the `ai_docs/templates/` directory
2. Copy the appropriate template for your document type
3. Save it to your chosen location with a descriptive filename in UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.md format

## Step 4: Fill in the Template

1. Replace the placeholder title with a clear, descriptive title
2. Write a concise purpose statement
3. Fill in each section with relevant content
4. Use appropriate formatting:
   - Headings for sections (## for main sections, ### for subsections)
   - Lists for sequential steps or related items
   - Tables for structured data
   - Code blocks for code examples
   - Bold for emphasis
   - Italics for definitions

## Step 5: Add Diagrams and Images (if needed)

1. Create clear, simple diagrams that illustrate complex concepts
2. Save images in SVG format when possible
3. Place images in the appropriate directory
4. Reference images using relative paths
5. Include descriptive alt text for accessibility

## Step 6: Add References and Links

1. Link to related documentation using relative paths
2. Include external references where appropriate
3. Use descriptive link text
4. Verify all links work

## Step 7: Review Your Documentation

Before submitting, review your documentation for:

1. **Accuracy**: Is all information correct?
2. **Completeness**: Does it cover all necessary aspects?
3. **Clarity**: Is it easy to understand?
4. **Consistency**: Does it follow our standards?
5. **Security**: Does it avoid exposing sensitive information?
6. **Grammar and spelling**: Is it free of errors?

## Step 8: Submit for Review

1. Commit your changes to a branch
2. Create a pull request
3. Request reviews from appropriate team members
4. Address any feedback

## Step 9: Maintain Your Documentation

1. Set a reminder to review the documentation periodically
2. Update when related code or processes change
3. Update the version history when making significant changes

## Examples

### Good Example

```markdown
# User Authentication Process

## Purpose

This document describes the standard process for implementing user authentication in our applications.

## Overview

Our authentication system uses OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens to provide secure, stateless authentication.

## Implementation Steps

1. Configure the authentication provider
2. Implement the login flow
3. Validate tokens on protected routes
4. Handle token refresh

## Security Considerations

- Store tokens securely
- Implement proper CSRF protection
- Use HTTPS for all authentication traffic
```

### Poor Example (What to Avoid)

```markdown
# Auth Stuff

Here's how to do auth:

1. Set up auth
2. Make login work
3. Check if user is logged in

Remember to be secure!
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Markdown not rendering correctly | Check syntax against Markdown reference |
| Images not displaying | Verify file paths and image format |
| Links not working | Check for typos in URLs and relative paths |

## Version History

| Version | Date | Author | Description |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|
| 1.0 | [Date] | [Author] | Initial version |
