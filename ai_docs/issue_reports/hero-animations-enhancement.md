# Enhancement: Add More Animations to Hero Section

## Description
The current Hero section on our landing page lacks engaging animations that could improve user experience and visual appeal. Adding subtle, performant animations would enhance the initial impression for visitors and better showcase our platform's modern design approach.

## Current Behavior
The Hero section currently has minimal or no animations. Elements appear static when the page loads, missing an opportunity to guide user attention and create a more dynamic first impression.

## Proposed Enhancement
Add tasteful, performance-optimized animations to the Hero section including:
1. Staggered fade-in animations for hero text elements
2. Subtle hover effects on CTA buttons
3. Background element animations (subtle parallax or floating shapes)
4. Animated illustrations or icons that represent key features

## Technical Analysis

### Files Affected
- `app/components/ui/hero.tsx` (primary file to be created/modified)
- `app/page.tsx` (may need updates to accommodate new animation props)

### Implementation Approach
1. Utilize Framer Motion for React-based animations
2. Implement staggered animations with proper accessibility considerations
3. Ensure animations are disabled for users with reduced motion preferences
4. Optimize for performance with proper will-change hints and GPU acceleration

### Code Example
```tsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

// Example staggered animation for hero elements
const containerVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      staggerChildren: 0.15
    }
  }
};

const itemVariants = {
  hidden: { y: 20, opacity: 0 },
  visible: {
    y: 0,
    opacity: 1,
    transition: { type: "spring", stiffness: 300, damping: 24 }
  }
};

// Component implementation with animations
export function Hero() {
  return (
    <motion.div
      className="hero-container"
      initial="hidden"
      animate="visible"
      variants={containerVariants}
    >
      <motion.h1 variants={itemVariants}>
        Learn Specialized Skills from Expert Creators
      </motion.h1>
      
      <motion.p variants={itemVariants}>
        Discover niche tutorials from passionate instructors
      </motion.p>
      
      <motion.div variants={itemVariants}>
        <Button>Get Started</Button>
      </motion.div>
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```

## Testing Requirements
- Test animations on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Verify animations respect reduced motion settings
- Measure performance impact (FPS, layout shifts)
- Test with screen readers to ensure accessibility

## Environment
- All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile and desktop devices
- Consider low-power devices for performance testing

## Additional Context
- Animations should align with our brand personality: professional but approachable
- Animation timing should be quick enough not to delay user interaction
- Consider implementing an animation toggle in user settings for those who prefer minimal animations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Animations are smooth and don't cause layout shifts
- [ ] All animations respect user's reduced motion preferences
- [ ] Performance metrics remain within acceptable thresholds
- [ ] Animations are consistent with our design system
- [ ] Animations work across all supported browsers and devices
