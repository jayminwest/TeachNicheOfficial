# Remove Coming Soon Page

## Description
The Coming Soon page needs to be removed now that we are ready for full launch. After code review, this is a simple removal as the page is not referenced in navigation or other components.

## Technical Analysis

### Files Affected:
- app/coming-soon/page.tsx - Delete entire file

### Type of Changes:
- Simple deletion of Coming Soon page component
- No navigation or routing updates needed

## Steps to Reproduce Current Behavior
1. Visit /coming-soon route
2. Note Coming Soon page displays with "Return Home" button

## Expected Behavior After Changes
1. /coming-soon route should return 404 (no special redirect needed since page wasn't linked from anywhere)
2. All other routes and functionality remain unchanged

## Testing Requirements
- Verify /coming-soon route returns appropriate 404
- Verify no regressions in main navigation
- Test on both desktop and mobile viewports

## Implementation Notes
- Simple deletion of app/coming-soon/page.tsx
- No other changes required

## Labels
- cleanup
- good first issue

## Priority
Low

## Estimated Effort
Very Small (< 30 minutes)
