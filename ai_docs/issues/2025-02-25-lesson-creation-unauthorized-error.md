# Fix: Lesson Creation Unauthorized Error

## Issue Description

When attempting to create a new lesson, the process completes video upload successfully but fails at the final step with a 401 Unauthorized error. The API returns "Authentication required" despite the user being logged in and authenticated throughout the rest of the application.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to the lesson creation page
3. Fill out all required lesson details (title, description, price, etc.)
4. Upload a video file (this step completes successfully)
5. Click "Create Lesson" button
6. Observe the error: "Failed to create lesson: Unauthorized"

## Expected Behavior

The lesson should be created successfully and the user should be redirected to the lesson detail page or dashboard.

## Technical Analysis

Based on the console logs, the issue occurs in the following sequence:

1. Video upload to Mux completes successfully
2. Mux asset is created and ready with a playback ID
3. The POST request to `/api/lessons` endpoint fails with a 401 Unauthorized status
4. The API returns `{error: 'Authentication required'}`

This suggests that while the user's authentication is working for the video upload process, it's not being properly passed or validated during the final lesson creation API call.

## Potential Causes

1. **Session Token Issue**: The authentication token might be missing, expired, or not properly included in the request to the `/api/lessons` endpoint.

2. **API Route Authentication**: The API route for lesson creation might have stricter authentication requirements than other routes, or the authentication middleware might be failing.

3. **CSRF Protection**: If CSRF protection is enabled, the token might be missing or invalid for this specific request.

4. **Session Persistence**: The user's session might be getting lost between the video upload and lesson creation steps.

5. **Permission Issues**: The user might be authenticated but lacking the necessary permissions to create lessons.

## Likely Affected Files

1. API route handler for lesson creation (`/app/api/lessons/route.ts` or similar)
2. Authentication middleware or service
3. Lesson form submission handler in the frontend
4. Session management code

## Testing Requirements

1. Verify authentication is working properly throughout the application
2. Check that auth tokens are being correctly passed in API requests
3. Ensure the lesson creation API endpoint correctly validates authentication
4. Test with different user roles/permissions if applicable

## Environment

- **Browser**: Chrome (latest)
- **Environment**: Development (localhost:3000)
- **Authentication Provider**: Supabase Auth

## Priority

High - This blocks a core functionality of the platform (lesson creation).

## Additional Context

The issue appears after successful video processing, suggesting that the authentication works for the video upload API but fails specifically for the lesson creation endpoint. This points to an issue with how authentication is being handled or passed to that specific endpoint.
