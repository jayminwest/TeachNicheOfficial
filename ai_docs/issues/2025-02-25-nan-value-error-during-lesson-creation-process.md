# Fix: NaN Value Error During Lesson Creation Process [RESOLVED]

## Description

During the lesson creation process, the following error was occurring:

```
Received NaN for the `value` attribute. If this is expected, cast the value to a string.
```

This error was occurring in the lesson form component where the price field was sometimes receiving a NaN value instead of a valid number or string.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to the lesson creation form
2. Fill out the form fields
3. Observe the console error: "Received NaN for the `value` attribute"

## Expected Behavior

The form should properly validate numeric inputs and either:
- Prevent NaN values from being assigned to input fields
- Cast NaN values to strings when necessary
- Display appropriate validation errors to the user

## Technical Analysis

The issue was occurring in the price field of the lesson creation form. The root cause was:
- An empty or non-numeric string was being converted to a number incorrectly
- The resulting NaN value was being directly assigned to the input value attribute

## Solution Implemented

1. Created a utility function to safely handle numeric values:
```typescript
const safeNumberValue = (value: any): string => {
  if (value === undefined || value === null || Number.isNaN(value)) {
    return ''; // Return empty string instead of NaN
  }
  return String(value); // Cast valid numbers to string
};
```

2. Applied this function to the price input field in the lesson form component
3. Added validation to ensure proper handling of numeric inputs

## Affected Files

- `app/components/ui/lesson-form.tsx` - Updated to safely handle price values

## Testing Completed

The form has been tested with various inputs:
- Valid numeric values
- Empty values
- Non-numeric text
- Negative numbers
- Decimal values

No console errors appear during form interaction, and form validation works correctly for all input scenarios.

## Environment

- Browser: All browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Device: Desktop and mobile
- React version: Latest in the project

## Additional Context

This was a common React warning that occurs when an input with `type="number"` receives a non-numeric value. The fix ensures proper type handling and validation throughout the form.
