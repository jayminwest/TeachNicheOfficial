# Pre-Launch Audit and Bug Fix Plan

## Issue Description

Before launching the Teach Niche platform, we need to conduct a comprehensive audit to identify and fix bugs, remove unused code, and ensure all critical functionality works correctly with real API integrations (Supabase, Stripe, Mux).

## Areas to Audit

### Authentication System
- Test complete sign-up and sign-in flows with real Supabase integration
- Verify email verification process
- Test social authentication options
- Check authentication persistence across page refreshes
- Verify proper handling of expired sessions

### Payment Processing
- Test complete payment flow with Stripe test mode
- Verify correct fee calculations (85% to creators, platform fee, Stripe processing fees)
- Test checkout session creation and completion
- Verify webhook handling for payment events
- Test payment error scenarios and recovery

### Video Management
- Test video uploads to Mux with various file types and sizes
- Verify video processing status updates
- Test video playback across devices and browsers
- Check thumbnail generation
- Verify access control for paid vs. free content

### Creator Experience
- Test creator application process
- Verify lesson creation workflow
- Test analytics dashboard with real data
- Verify earnings calculations and reporting
- Test payout system integration

### User Experience
- Test lesson discovery and filtering
- Verify purchased lesson access
- Test responsive design across devices
- Check performance on slower connections
- Verify accessibility compliance

### Code Quality
- Identify and remove unused components
- Check for redundant API calls
- Verify proper error handling throughout the application
- Test edge cases for all critical flows

## Technical Analysis

The codebase shows a well-structured Next.js application with React components, TypeScript typing, and integration with several third-party services:

1. **Frontend**: Next.js with React components and Shadcn UI
2. **Backend**: Next.js API routes and Edge Functions
3. **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
4. **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
5. **Payments**: Stripe (v2025-01-27.acacia) with merchant of record model
6. **Video**: Mux Video

Key files that need thorough testing include:
- Authentication components (`auth-dialog.tsx`, `sign-in.tsx`, `sign-up.tsx`)
- Payment processing (`lesson-checkout.tsx`, `stripe.ts`)
- Video handling (`video-uploader.tsx`, `video-player.tsx`, `mux.ts`)
- Creator tools (`lesson-form.tsx`, `earnings-link.tsx`, `bank-account-form.tsx`)

## Testing Requirements

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Verify component rendering
   - Test utility functions (especially fee calculations)
   - Validate form validations

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test API endpoints with real services
   - Verify database operations
   - Test authentication flows

3. **End-to-End Tests**:
   - Complete user journeys (signup → purchase → access)
   - Creator journeys (signup → create content → receive payment)
   - Error recovery scenarios

4. **Manual Testing Checklist**:
   - Cross-browser compatibility
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Performance under various network conditions
   - Edge cases and error states

## Implementation Plan

1. Create test accounts and API keys for all services
2. Develop a systematic testing script covering all critical paths
3. Document all issues found with severity ratings
4. Prioritize fixes based on impact and complexity
5. Implement fixes in batches, starting with critical payment and authentication issues
6. Conduct regression testing after each batch of fixes
7. Final verification of all systems before launch

## Affected Files

This audit will potentially affect numerous files across the codebase, with particular focus on:

- Authentication components and services
- Payment processing components and API routes
- Video upload and playback components
- Creator dashboard and analytics
- User-facing lesson discovery and access components

## Dependencies and Side Effects

Changes to core functionality may have cascading effects:
- Authentication changes could affect user sessions and protected routes
- Payment system modifications might impact creator earnings calculations
- Video processing changes could affect content availability

All changes must be tested in isolation and as part of complete user journeys to ensure no regressions are introduced.
