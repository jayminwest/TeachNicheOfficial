## Technical Analysis

The codebase shows a well-structured Next.js application with React components, TypeScript typing, and integration with several third-party services:

1. **Frontend**: Next.js with React components and Shadcn UI
2. **Backend**: Next.js API routes and Edge Functions
3. **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
4. **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
5. **Payments**: Stripe (v2025-01-27.acacia) with merchant of record model
6. **Video**: Mux Video

Key files that need thorough testing include:
- Authentication components (`auth-dialog.tsx`, `sign-in.tsx`, `sign-up.tsx`)
- Payment processing (`lesson-checkout.tsx`, `stripe.ts`)
- Video handling (`video-uploader.tsx`, `video-player.tsx`, `mux.ts`)
- Creator tools (`lesson-form.tsx`, `earnings-link.tsx`, `bank-account-form.tsx`)
- State management implementation (context providers, hooks)
- API route handlers and data fetching logic
- Error boundary components and error handling utilities
- Form validation and submission handlers

## Testing Requirements

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Verify component rendering
   - Test utility functions (especially fee calculations)
