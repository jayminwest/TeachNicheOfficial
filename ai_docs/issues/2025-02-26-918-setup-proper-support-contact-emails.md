# Setup Proper Support and Contact Emails

## Issue Type: Enhancement

## Description
Currently, the platform only has a single email address (jaymin@teach-niche.com) configured, which is experiencing delivery issues. We need to establish a comprehensive email infrastructure for the platform using Google Workspace, with proper configuration to ensure reliable delivery.

## Technical Details

### Current State
- Single email address: jaymin@teach-niche.com
- Emails are being blocked from sending
- No proper SPF, DKIM, or DMARC records
- No dedicated support or contact email addresses
- No email automation or routing system

### Required Email Addresses
1. support@teach-niche.com - For customer support inquiries
2. contact@teach-niche.com - For general inquiries
3. no-reply@teach-niche.com - For system notifications
4. security@teach-niche.com - For security-related communications
5. billing@teach-niche.com - For payment and subscription inquiries

### Technical Requirements

#### DNS Configuration
- Set up proper SPF records to authorize Google Workspace to send emails on behalf of teach-niche.com
- Configure DKIM signing for all outgoing emails
- Implement DMARC policy to prevent email spoofing
- Verify domain ownership in Google Workspace

#### Google Workspace Configuration
- Create and configure all required email addresses
- Set up email groups and routing rules
- Configure email aliases as needed
- Implement email templates for common responses

#### Application Integration
- Update all email sending functions to use the appropriate sender addresses
- Implement proper error handling for email delivery issues
- Set up email delivery monitoring and reporting
- Configure email bounce handling

#### Automation
- Set up auto-responders for support and contact emails
- Implement email filtering and categorization
- Configure notification rules for high-priority emails

## Implementation Steps

1. **DNS Configuration**
   - Add SPF record: `v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all`
   - Generate and add DKIM keys through Google Workspace
   - Add DMARC record: `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@teach-niche.com`

2. **Google Workspace Setup**
   ```bash
   # Script to create email addresses via Google Workspace Admin SDK
   # Requires Google Workspace Admin SDK credentials
   
   # Create support email
   gam create user support firstname "Support" lastname "Team" password "SECURE_PASSWORD" changepassword on
   
   # Create contact email
   gam create user contact firstname "Contact" lastname "Team" password "SECURE_PASSWORD" changepassword on
   
   # Create no-reply email
   gam create user no-reply firstname "System" lastname "Notifications" password "SECURE_PASSWORD" changepassword off
   
   # Create security email
   gam create user security firstname "Security" lastname "Team" password "SECURE_PASSWORD" changepassword on
   
   # Create billing email
   gam create user billing firstname "Billing" lastname "Team" password "SECURE_PASSWORD" changepassword on
   
   # Create email group for support team
   gam create group support-team name "Support Team" description "Internal support team group"
   
   # Add members to support team
   gam update group support-team add member jaymin@teach-niche.com
   gam update group support-team add member support@teach-niche.com
   ```

3. **Email Verification and Testing**
   - Verify all email addresses can send and receive emails
   - Test email delivery to major providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.)
   - Verify SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are properly configured using online tools

4. **Application Integration**
   - Update email sending configuration in the application
   - Implement proper error handling and retry logic
   - Set up monitoring for email delivery issues

## Testing Requirements

1. **Email Delivery Testing**
   - Send test emails from each address to various email providers
   - Verify emails are not marked as spam
   - Check email headers for proper SPF, DKIM, and DMARC validation

2. **Application Integration Testing**
   - Test all email sending functionality in the application
   - Verify correct sender addresses are used for different types of emails
   - Test error handling for email delivery failures

3. **Automation Testing**
   - Verify auto-responders are working correctly
   - Test email routing and filtering rules
   - Verify notification systems for high-priority emails

## Affected Components
- DNS Configuration
- Google Workspace Setup
- Email Sending Services in Application
- Notification Systems
- User Communication Flows

## Dependencies
- Google Workspace Admin Account with appropriate permissions
