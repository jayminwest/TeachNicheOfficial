# Add Global Accessibility Support

## Description

Teach Niche needs to be accessible to users worldwide to maximize its reach and impact in the kendama community. Currently, the platform has limited international support, which restricts its accessibility to non-English speaking users and those in regions with different payment systems or internet connectivity challenges.

## Technical Requirements

- Implement locale-aware date and number formatting

### Payment Localization
- Add support for multiple currencies beyond USD
- Integrate regional payment methods popular in different countries
- Implement adaptive pricing based on purchasing power parity
- Ensure tax compliance across different regions

### Technical Accessibility
- Implement Progressive Web App (PWA) features for offline access
- Create a low-bandwidth mode for regions with limited internet
