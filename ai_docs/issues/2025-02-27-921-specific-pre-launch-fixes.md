# Specific Pre-Launch Fixes

Based on a detailed code review, these are the specific issues that need to be addressed before launch.

## Critical Issues

### Authentication

1. **Auth State Synchronization**
   - Issue: The `AuthContext.tsx` doesn't properly handle auth state synchronization across multiple tabs
   - Fix: Implement browser storage event listeners to detect auth changes in other tabs

2. **Error Handling in Sign-Up Flow**
   - Issue: The Google sign-in error handling in `sign-up.tsx` is too generic
   - Fix: Add specific error handling for common OAuth errors (popup blocked, user cancelled, etc.)

### Payment Processing

1. **Stripe Checkout Security**
   - Issue: The checkout process in `lesson-checkout.tsx` doesn't validate the price against the database
   - Fix: Add server-side price validation in the `/api/payments/create-checkout/route.ts` endpoint

2. **Payment Intent Handling**
   - Issue: The payment intent ID is updated in the database before confirmation
   - Fix: Only update after successful checkout completion via webhook

### Video Management

1. **Upload Error Recovery**
   - Issue: The `video-uploader.tsx` component doesn't provide a way to retry failed uploads
   - Fix: Add retry functionality for failed uploads

2. **Playback Security**
   - Issue: The JWT token for Mux playback in `video-player.tsx` doesn't have an expiration
   - Fix: Add proper expiration to the JWT token

## High Priority Issues

### Performance

1. **Video Player Loading**
   - Issue: The Mux player loads even when hidden behind the access gate
   - Fix: Lazy load the player only when access is confirmed

2. **Auth Context Optimization**
   - Issue: The auth context causes unnecessary re-renders
   - Fix: Implement memoization for the `isCreator` function

### Security

1. **Input Validation**
   - Issue: The price input in checkout lacks client-side validation
   - Fix: Add proper validation before submission

2. **API Rate Limiting**
   - Issue: Missing rate limiting on authentication and payment endpoints
   - Fix: Implement rate limiting middleware

### Error Handling

1. **Comprehensive Error States**
   - Issue: Video upload error messages are generic
   - Fix: Add more specific error messages for different failure scenarios

2. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Issue: The app doesn't handle Mux service unavailability gracefully
   - Fix: Add fallback UI for service outages

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Critical Fixes

1. Authentication improvements:
   - Implement cross-tab synchronization
   - Enhance error handling in sign-up flow

2. Payment processing security:
   - Add server-side price validation
   - Fix payment intent handling

3. Video management:
   - Add upload retry functionality
   - Implement proper JWT expiration

### Week 2: High Priority Fixes

1. Performance optimizations:
   - Lazy load video player
   - Optimize auth context

2. Security enhancements:
   - Implement input validation
   - Add rate limiting

3. Error handling improvements:
   - Enhance error messages
   - Add graceful degradation

## Testing Checklist

For each fix, the following tests must be performed:

1. Unit tests for individual components
2. Integration tests for component interactions
3. End-to-end tests for complete user journeys
4. Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
5. Mobile responsiveness testing
6. Performance testing before and after changes

## Specific Test Cases

1. **Authentication**
   - Test sign-in/sign-up in multiple tabs simultaneously
   - Test session expiration and renewal
   - Test error scenarios (network failure, invalid credentials)

2. **Payment Processing**
   - Test checkout with various payment methods
   - Test price manipulation attempts
   - Test webhook handling for successful/failed payments

3. **Video Management**
   - Test uploads of various file types and sizes
   - Test interrupted uploads and retries
   - Test playback with different network conditions

## Monitoring Plan

After implementing these fixes, we should set up:

1. Error tracking with detailed context
2. Performance monitoring for key user journeys
3. Real-time alerts for payment and authentication failures
4. Usage metrics for video uploads and playbacks

This focused plan addresses the most critical issues identified in the codebase while providing a clear path to launch.
