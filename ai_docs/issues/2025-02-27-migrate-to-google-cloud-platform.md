## Description
This issue outlines the plan to migrate our infrastructure from Supabase to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to create a more unified technology stack and leverage Google's ecosystem for our business operations.

## Motivation
As we're still pre-launch with no existing data, this is an ideal time to make a strategic infrastructure decision. Moving to GCP will allow us to:

1. Create a unified ecosystem with Google Workspace for email and business operations
2. Leverage enterprise-grade infrastructure that can scale with our needs
3. Access advanced capabilities like ML/AI that could provide future competitive advantages
4. Avoid technical debt and future migration challenges
5. Present a more professional impression to instructors and students

## Current Implementation
Currently, our application uses:
- Supabase for database, authentication, and storage
- Next.js for frontend and API routes
- Vercel for hosting
- Stripe for payments
- Mux for video processing

## Proposed Implementation
We will migrate to a GCP-based infrastructure:

1. **Database**: Replace Supabase PostgreSQL with Cloud SQL or Firestore
2. **Authentication**: Replace Supabase Auth with Firebase Authentication
3. **Storage**: Replace Supabase Storage with Cloud Storage
4. **Email**: Implement Google Workspace integration for email management
5. **Analytics**: Add Google Analytics and BigQuery for data analysis
6. **Infrastructure**: Define infrastructure as code using Terraform

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Planning
- [x] Create GCP project and configure initial IAM permissions (Project: teachnicheofficial)
- [x] Install necessary dependencies (Google Cloud libraries, Terraform, Google Cloud SDK)
- [x] Set up authentication with Google account
- [x] Create service abstraction layers for database, auth, storage, and email
- [ ] Set up billing alerts and monitoring
- [x] Define initial infrastructure as code with Terraform
- [x] Create development environment in GCP

### Phase 2: Core Services Migration
- [x] Migrate database schema to Cloud SQL (script created)
- [x] Set up Firebase project and Firestore database
- [x] Implement Firebase Authentication
- [ ] Update API routes to use GCP services
- [x] Implement Firebase Storage service
- [x] Create script to migrate files to Firebase Storage
- [x] Execute file migration (no files found in Supabase buckets)
- [ ] Remove Supabase dependencies and references

### Phase 3: Email and Advanced Services
- [x] Set up Google Workspace integration
- [x] Implement email service for notifications
- [ ] Create waitlist notification system
- [ ] Add analytics and monitoring

### Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
- [ ] Comprehensive testing of all migrated services
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipelines for GCP deployment
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization
- [ ] Security review and hardening

## Technical Details

## Dependencies
- Google Cloud SDK
- Firebase Admin SDK
- Google APIs Node.js Client
- Terraform (for infrastructure as code)

## Estimated Effort
- Planning and setup: 2-3 days
- Core services migration: 5-7 days
- Email and advanced services: 3-4 days
- Testing and deployment: 3-5 days
- Total: 13-19 days

## Risks and Mitigation
1. **Learning Curve**: GCP has a steeper learning curve compared to Supabase
   - Mitigation: Allocate time for learning and documentation
   
2. **Cost Management**: GCP pricing can be complex
   - Mitigation: Set up detailed budget alerts and monitoring

3. **Service Disruption**: Ensuring smooth transition without service disruption
   - Mitigation: Develop and test thoroughly in parallel environment before switching

4. **Vendor Lock-in**: Increased dependency on Google ecosystem
   - Mitigation: Design with abstraction layers to reduce direct coupling

## Success Criteria
- All application functionality works with GCP services
- Performance meets or exceeds current implementation
- Infrastructure is defined as code and reproducible
- Proper monitoring and alerting is in place
- Documentation is updated to reflect new architecture

## Additional Notes
- This migration should be completed before public launch to avoid future migration challenges with live user data
- Whenever possible, use gcloud CLI commands to configure resources instead of the console UI to ensure reproducibility
- Document all CLI commands used for configuration to enable future automation
- Current Firebase setup uses the project ID "teachnicheofficial"
- Firestore database has been created in the us-central region
- Security rules for Firestore and Storage have been deployed
- The abstraction layers in `app/services/` directory allow for gradual migration
- Need to create a centralized Firebase configuration file to replace Supabase references
- Need to create a Cloud SQL instance for database migration
- Need to fix test scripts to properly handle ESM imports and environment variables
- Need to update 253 Supabase references in 58 files to use GCP services
