# Populate Database with Test Data and Configure Environment-Specific Databases

## Issue Description

We need to create a comprehensive test data generation system for our database to support development, testing, and demonstration environments. Additionally, we need to configure separate database environments for development and production to ensure proper isolation.

## Technical Requirements

### Database Environment Configuration

1. **Environment Separation**
   - Configure separate database instances for:
     - Development environment
     - Production environment
   - Update Terraform configurations to support this separation
   - Implement environment-specific connection strings

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Create environment-specific configuration files
   - Implement environment detection in the application
   - Document the environment variable requirements

### Test Data Generation

1. **Data Generation Script**
   - Create a TypeScript script to generate realistic test data
   - Support incremental data generation
   - Include all core entities in the data model
   - Ensure referential integrity across generated data

2. **Entity Coverage**
   - Users/Profiles (instructors and students)
   - Categories and subcategories
   - Lessons with realistic content
   - Reviews and ratings
   - Payment records (simulated)
   - User interactions and analytics data

3. **Data Volumes**
   - Small dataset (10-20 users, 5-10 lessons) for quick testing
   - Medium dataset (100+ users, 50+ lessons) for performance testing
   - Large dataset (1000+ users, 500+ lessons) for stress testing

## Implementation Details

### Database Environment Configuration

1. **Terraform Updates**
   - Modify Terraform configurations to create environment-specific resources
   - Implement naming conventions that include environment identifiers
   - Configure appropriate resource sizing based on environment

2. **Connection Management**
   - Create a database connection factory that selects the appropriate connection based on environment
   - Implement connection pooling appropriate for each environment
   - Add logging for connection events in development environment

### Test Data Generation

1. **Script Architecture**
   - Create a modular script system with separate generators for each entity type
   - Implement a dependency graph to ensure entities are created in the correct order
   - Add command-line options to control generation parameters

2. **Data Quality**
   - Use realistic data patterns (names, emails, content)
   - Create varied content lengths and types
   - Generate realistic timestamps with appropriate distribution
   - Ensure data represents various user scenarios and edge cases

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Implement batch processing for large data volumes
   - Add progress reporting for long-running operations
   - Include error handling with retry logic

## Affected Files and Components

### Primary Files
- `scripts/generate-test-data.ts` (new file)
- `scripts/setup-environment.ts` (new file)
- `terraform/environments/dev/main.tf`
- `terraform/environments/prod/main.tf` (new directory/file)
- `app/lib/database.ts` (for environment-specific connections)

### Secondary Files
- `.env.development`
- `.env.production`
- `README.md` (documentation updates)

## Testing Requirements

1. **Validation Tests**
   - Verify all generated entities meet schema requirements
   - Confirm referential integrity across all relationships
   - Test boundary conditions (empty strings, max lengths, etc.)

2. **Environment Tests**
   - Verify correct database connection based on environment
   - Test environment variable fallbacks
   - Confirm isolation between environments

## User Impact

- Developers will have realistic data for testing without manual creation
- Demo environments will have consistent, high-quality sample data
- Production data will remain isolated from development activities

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Terraform configurations successfully create separate dev and prod databases
2. Test data generation script successfully creates all required entities
3. Application correctly connects to the appropriate database based on environment
4. Documentation clearly explains how to use the test data generation system
5. All generated data meets validation requirements

## Priority and Effort

- **Priority**: High (Blocking for effective development)
- **Estimated Effort**: Medium (3-5 days)
- **Complexity**: Medium

## Additional Context

This system will significantly improve our development workflow by providing consistent test data across all environments. It will also ensure proper isolation between development and production data, which is critical for security and data integrity.
