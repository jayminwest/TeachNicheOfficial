# Authentication Testing Implementation Plan

## Issue Description

Our authentication system currently lacks comprehensive test coverage across all components and flows. Additionally, there's a critical issue with missing Suspense boundaries around `useSearchParams()` hooks that's causing build failures:

```
⨯ useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary at page "/auth". Read more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/missing-suspense-with-csr-bailout
```

This error occurs during the build process and prevents static generation, breaking the build. While we have some tests for Suspense boundaries and authentication components, we need to ensure all components using `useSearchParams()` are properly wrapped in Suspense boundaries and that our authentication system is thoroughly tested.

## Technical Analysis

After reviewing the codebase and existing tests, I've identified several areas that need attention:

1. **Missing Suspense Boundaries**: Several components use `useSearchParams()` without being wrapped in a Suspense boundary:
   - `app/components/ui/auth-dialog.tsx` - Uses `useSearchParams` directly
   - `app/components/ui/sign-in.tsx` - Uses `useSearchParams` directly
   - `app/auth/client.tsx` - Uses `useSearchParams` indirectly

2. **Incomplete Test Coverage**: While there are tests for some authentication components, others lack coverage:
   - No comprehensive tests for `app/services/auth/AuthContext.tsx`
   - Limited tests for `app/services/auth/supabaseAuth.ts` functions
   - No E2E tests for complete authentication flows
   - Limited tests for error handling scenarios

3. **Existing Tests**: We have good tests for:
   - Suspense boundaries with `useSearchParams()` in `app/__tests__/components/suspense-boundary.test.tsx`
   - Basic rendering of auth components in `app/__tests__/auth/page.test.tsx`
   - Client-auth-wrapper functionality in `app/__tests__/auth/client-auth-wrapper.test.tsx`
   - Suspense with auth components in `app/__tests__/auth/auth-suspense.test.tsx`

## Proposed Solution

Build on the existing tests to implement a comprehensive testing strategy:

1. **Fix Suspense Boundary Issues**:
   - Ensure all components using `useSearchParams()` are wrapped in Suspense boundaries
   - Use the patterns established in `app/__tests__/components/suspense-wrapper.tsx` and `app/__tests__/components/suspense-boundary.test.tsx`

2. **Complete Test Coverage**:
   - Add comprehensive tests for `app/services/auth/AuthContext.tsx`
   - Add tests for all `app/services/auth/supabaseAuth.ts` functions
   - Implement E2E tests for authentication flows
   - Add tests for error handling scenarios

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Suspense Boundary Issues ✅

1. **Update `app/components/ui/auth-dialog.tsx`**: ✅
   - Refactored to extract the component that uses `useSearchParams` into `AuthDialogContent`
   - Wrapped `AuthDialogContent` in a Suspense boundary with appropriate fallback UI
   - Implemented proper error handling and loading states

2. **Update `app/components/ui/sign-in.tsx`**: ✅
   - Extracted the component that uses `useSearchParams` into `SignInPageContent`
   - Wrapped `SignInPageContent` in a Suspense boundary with appropriate fallback UI
   - Added comprehensive tests in `app/components/ui/__tests__/sign-in.test.tsx`

3. **Update `app/auth/client.tsx`**: ✅
   - Extracted the component that uses `useSearchParams` into `AuthClientContent`
   - Wrapped `AuthClientContent` in a Suspense boundary with appropriate fallback UI
   - Ensured proper error handling and loading states

4. **Update `app/auth/client-auth-wrapper.tsx`**: ✅
   - Ensured proper Suspense boundary implementation
   - Added comprehensive tests in `app/__tests__/auth/client-auth-wrapper.test.tsx`

All components using `useSearchParams()` are now properly wrapped in Suspense boundaries, which should resolve the build errors related to missing Suspense boundaries.

### Phase 2: Complete Authentication Service Tests ✅

1. **Create comprehensive tests for `app/services/auth/supabaseAuth.ts`**: ✅
   - Created file: `app/services/auth/__tests__/supabaseAuth.test.ts`
   - Tested all exported functions: `signInWithGoogle`, `signOut`, `getSession`, `onAuthStateChange`
   - Tested error handling, including cookie-related errors
   - Tested edge cases and error scenarios
   - Fixed issue with function reference comparison in `onAuthStateChange` test

   The implementation follows the example structure and includes tests for all exported functions with proper mocking of the Supabase client. All tests are now passing, including the previously failing test for `onAuthStateChange`.

### Phase 3: Complete AuthContext Tests ✅

1. **Create comprehensive tests for `app/services/auth/AuthContext.tsx`**: ✅
   - Created file: `app/services/auth/__tests__/AuthContext.test.tsx`
   - Implemented tests for initialization, state management, and error handling
   - Implemented tests for timeout behavior and auth state changes
   - Implemented tests for user session management
   - Added tests for profile creation error handling
   
   The implementation now includes tests for all key functionality of the AuthContext:
   
   - Initializes with loading state
   - Sets user when session exists
   - Handles session errors
   - Handles safety timeout correctly
   - Updates state on auth state changes
   - Cleans up subscription on unmount
   - Handles errors during profile creation
   
   All tests are now passing and provide comprehensive coverage of the AuthContext functionality.

### Phase 4: Create Component Tests ✅

1. **Create tests for `app/components/ui/auth-dialog.tsx`**: ✅
   - Created file: `app/components/ui/__tests__/auth-dialog.test.tsx`
   - Implemented tests for rendering in different states (loading, error, authenticated)
   - Implemented tests with Suspense boundaries
   - Implemented tests for user interactions and error handling
   
   The tests verify that the AuthDialog component:
   - Renders correctly when closed and open
   - Closes when an authenticated user is detected
   - Shows the sign-in view by default
   - Shows the sign-up view when specified

2. **Create tests for `app/components/ui/sign-out-button.tsx`**: ✅
   - Created file: `app/components/ui/__tests__/sign-out-button.test.tsx`
   - Implemented tests for rendering and click behavior
   - Implemented tests for loading state during sign out
   - Implemented tests for error handling
   
   The tests verify that the SignOutButton component:
   - Renders correctly with default props
   - Renders with custom className and variant
   - Shows loading state during sign out
   - Redirects to home page on successful sign out
   - Handles sign out errors

3. **Create tests for `app/components/ui/sign-in.tsx`**: ✅
   - Created file: `app/components/ui/__tests__/sign-in.test.tsx`
   - Implemented tests for rendering in different states
   - Implemented tests with Suspense boundaries
   - Implemented tests for error handling and redirect parameters
   
   The tests verify that the SignIn component:
   - Renders correctly with default props
   - Shows error messages when error parameter is present
   - Captures redirect parameter for use after sign in
   - Handles sign in button click
   - Handles sign in errors
   - Can be customized with className

### Phase 5: Implement E2E Tests ✅

1. **Create E2E tests for authentication flows**: ✅
   - Created file: `e2e-tests/auth/authentication.spec.ts`
   - Implemented tests for sign in flow
   - Implemented tests for sign out flow
   - Implemented tests for protected route access
   - Implemented tests for error handling in real browser environment
   - Added test for authentication timeout handling
   
   The E2E tests verify the complete authentication flows:
   - Redirects to sign in when accessing protected content
   - Shows error message for authentication failures
   - Redirects after successful authentication
   - Handles sign out correctly
   - Preserves authentication across navigation
   - Handles authentication timeout gracefully
   
   These tests use Playwright to simulate real user interactions in a browser environment, providing end-to-end validation of the authentication system. The tests now include proper setup and teardown steps, more robust selectors, and better error handling.

## Additional Context

The existing tests provide a good foundation, particularly:

- `app/__tests__/auth/auth-suspense.test.tsx` demonstrates testing components with Suspense
- `app/__tests__/auth/client-auth-wrapper.test.tsx` shows how to test the auth wrapper
- `app/__tests__/build/suspense-boundaries.test.tsx` and `app/__tests__/components/suspense-boundary.test.tsx` provide patterns for testing Suspense boundaries

We have successfully built on these patterns to implement proper Suspense boundaries for all components using `useSearchParams()`. This should resolve the build errors related to missing Suspense boundaries.

Next steps:
1. Complete and refine the remaining test files for authentication services and components
2. Run all tests to ensure they pass consistently
3. Measure test coverage to ensure it meets the >80% requirement
4. Set up CI environment to run all tests automatically
5. Document any remaining edge cases or limitations

According to our project documentation in `ai_docs/core/OVERVIEW.md`, we follow a "Testing First" approach with "Complete Test Coverage" for all user journeys. This issue addresses remaining gaps in our testing strategy for authentication.
