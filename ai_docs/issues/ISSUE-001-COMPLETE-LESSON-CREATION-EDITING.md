# Issue: Complete Lesson Creation and Editing Feature

## Description

The lesson creation and editing feature needs to be finalized to production-ready status. This includes ensuring robust code quality, comprehensive testing, and a seamless user experience.

## Current Status

The basic lesson creation and editing functionality exists but requires refinement and completion to be considered production-ready. Key components like the lesson form, video uploader, and markdown editor are implemented but need additional work to ensure reliability and maintainability.

## Technical Requirements

1. **Code Quality**
   - Ensure all TypeScript types are properly defined and used
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Optimize performance for video uploads and processing
   - Ensure responsive design works across all device sizes

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Create comprehensive unit tests for all components
   - Implement end-to-end tests for the complete lesson creation flow
   - Add visual regression tests for the lesson editor UI
   - Test error states and edge cases thoroughly

3. **User Experience**
   - Implement proper loading states during video processing
   - Add validation feedback for all form inputs
   - Ensure accessibility compliance throughout the feature
   - Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

4. **Security**
   - Verify proper access controls for lesson editing
   - Ensure secure handling of video uploads
   - Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
   - Validate all user inputs server-side

## Implementation Tasks

### Backend
- [ ] Complete API endpoints for lesson CRUD operations
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and validation
- [ ] Add transaction support for multi-step operations
- [ ] Optimize database queries for performance

### Frontend
- [ ] Finalize lesson form UI and validation
- [ ] Complete video upload progress and status indicators
- [ ] Implement draft saving functionality
- [ ] Add preview capability for lessons before publishing

### Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for all lesson-related components
- [ ] Create end-to-end tests for the complete lesson creation flow
- [ ] Test error handling and recovery
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness

### Documentation
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Create user guide for lesson creation
- [ ] Add developer documentation for the lesson module
- [ ] Document testing approach and coverage

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can create, edit, and delete lessons with a smooth, intuitive interface
2. Video uploads work reliably with proper progress indication and error handling
3. Markdown editor functions correctly for lesson content creation
4. All form validations provide clear feedback to users
5. The feature works consistently across desktop and mobile devices
6. All tests pass with >90% coverage
7. Performance metrics meet or exceed targets (page load <2s, video processing feedback <500ms)
8. No TypeScript errors or warnings
9. Accessibility score of at least 95/100

## Related Components

- LessonForm
- VideoUploader
- MarkdownEditor
- LessonPreview
- VideoPlayer
- LessonAccessGate

## Priority

High - This feature is core to the platform's functionality and needs to be completed before public launch.

## Estimated Effort

Large - Requires significant work across frontend, backend, and testing infrastructure.

## Notes

This issue focuses on bringing an existing feature to completion rather than building something new. The emphasis should be on quality, reliability, and user experience rather than adding new capabilities.
