# Issue: Complete Lesson Creation and Editing Feature

## Description

The lesson creation and editing feature needs to be finalized to production-ready status. This includes ensuring robust code quality, comprehensive testing, and a seamless user experience. After reviewing the codebase, several specific areas need improvement.

## Current Status

The basic lesson creation functionality exists with:
- A form component (`app/components/ui/lesson-form.tsx`) that handles title, description, content, and price
- Video upload functionality via Mux integration (`app/components/ui/video-uploader.tsx`)
- API endpoints for lesson CRUD operations (`app/api/lessons/route.ts`)
- Mux video upload handling (`app/api/mux/upload/route.ts`)

However, several issues need to be addressed:

1. **Video Upload Reliability Issues**:
   - Complex retry logic in `VideoUploader` with nested functions and multiple API calls
   - Extensive console.log statements throughout the code
   - Manual CORS header management in multiple places
   - Overly complex error handling

2. **Form Implementation Issues**:
   - Debug logging in production code (e.g., `console.log("Form State:...")`)
   - Price field has special handling for NaN values, suggesting validation issues
   - No autosave/draft functionality
   - Limited feedback during form submission

3. **API Implementation Issues**:
   - Duplicated authentication logic across handler functions
   - Inconsistent error handling (some detailed errors, others generic)
   - Inconsistent use of `match()` vs `eq()` for queries
   - No input validation middleware or consistent validation pattern

4. **Missing Features**:
   - No draft saving functionality
   - No preview capability before publishing
   - Limited loading states during async operations
   - No confirmation for destructive actions

## Technical Requirements

1. **Code Quality**
   - Remove all debug console.log statements
   - Standardize error handling across components and API routes
   - Refactor complex logic into smaller, testable functions
   - Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all API responses

2. **API Improvements**
   - Create middleware for common operations (auth, validation)
   - Standardize error response format
   - Add proper input validation with zod schemas
   - Implement consistent database query patterns

3. **User Experience**
   - Add autosave functionality for drafts
   - Implement proper loading states for all async operations
   - Add preview capability before publishing
   - Improve form validation feedback
   - Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

4. **Video Upload Enhancements**
   - Simplify retry logic into a cleaner implementation
   - Move complex status checking to a dedicated service
   - Improve progress indicators and error recovery options
   - Support resumable uploads for large files

5. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Create unit tests for all components
   - Test API routes with mocked requests
   - Implement end-to-end tests for the complete lesson creation flow
   - Test error states and recovery paths

## Implementation Tasks

### Backend
- [ ] Refactor `app/api/lessons/route.ts` to use middleware for auth and validation
- [ ] Create a dedicated Mux service in `app/services/mux/index.ts`
- [ ] Standardize error handling across all API routes
- [ ] Add proper validation for all incoming data
- [ ] Implement transaction support for lesson creation
- [ ] Add pagination support for lesson listing
- [ ] Optimize database queries with proper indexing

### Frontend
- [ ] Remove all console.log statements from `LessonForm` and `VideoUploader`
- [ ] Fix price field validation to prevent NaN values at source
- [ ] Implement autosave functionality for drafts
- [ ] Add form dirty state tracking to prevent data loss
- [ ] Refactor video upload flow into a custom hook
- [ ] Improve loading states during form submission
- [ ] Create a `LessonPreview` component for content preview
- [ ] Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- [ ] Optimize mobile experience for all components

### Testing
- [ ] Create unit tests for `LessonForm` component
- [ ] Test validation logic for all form fields
- [ ] Test `VideoUploader` component with mocked API responses
- [ ] Test API route handlers with mocked requests
- [ ] Create Playwright tests for complete lesson creation flow
- [ ] Test error scenarios and recovery paths
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness

### Documentation
- [ ] Document API endpoints with request/response examples
- [ ] Create user guide for lesson creation
- [ ] Document the Mux integration architecture
- [ ] Add developer documentation for form state management
- [ ] Document testing approach and coverage

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Reliability**:
   - Video uploads complete successfully >99% of the time
   - Form submissions are never lost, even on network failures
   - All error states have clear recovery paths
   - API endpoints handle all edge cases gracefully

2. **User Experience**:
   - Users receive clear feedback during all operations
   - Loading states are present for all asynchronous operations
   - Form validation provides helpful, specific guidance
   - Mobile experience is fully functional
   - Autosave prevents data loss

3. **Performance**:
   - Form loads in <1s on typical connections
   - Video upload feedback is responsive (<500ms)
   - Form submission completes in <2s (excluding video processing)
   - API endpoints respond in <200ms (excluding video processing)

4. **Code Quality**:
   - No TypeScript errors or warnings
   - No console.log statements in production code
   - All components have proper prop validation
   - Test coverage >90% for all components
   - Consistent error handling patterns throughout

## Priority

High - This feature is core to the platform's functionality and needs to be completed before public launch.

## Estimated Effort

Large - Requires significant work across frontend, backend, and testing infrastructure.

## Notes

This issue focuses on bringing an existing feature to production quality. The emphasis should be on reliability, user experience, and maintainability rather than adding new capabilities. The current implementation has good foundations but needs refinement in several key areas to be considered production-ready.
