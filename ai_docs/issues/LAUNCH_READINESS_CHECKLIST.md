# Launch Readiness Checklist: Critical Issues for Teach Niche Platform

## Overview

This issue report serves as a comprehensive checklist for resolving critical issues before the product launch (deadline: tomorrow night). The focus areas are lesson creation, Stripe Connect integration, and various smaller bugs that impact core functionality.

## Priority 1: Lesson Creation Flow

### Issue Description
Users encounter errors during lesson creation, specifically when uploading video content. The error appears to be related to the Mux video integration:

```
Error creating upload URL: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'Uploads')
at Uploads (app/api/mux/upload-url/route.ts:34:31)
```

### Technical Analysis
- The error occurs in the `/api/mux/upload-url/route.ts` file at line 34
- The `Video.Uploads` object appears to be undefined, suggesting an initialization issue with the Mux SDK
- This blocks the entire lesson creation flow and prevents testing of the purchase flow

### Action Items
- [ ] Fix Mux SDK initialization in the upload URL API route
- [ ] Verify proper environment variables for Mux are set
- [ ] Test video upload functionality end-to-end
- [ ] Ensure uploaded videos are properly processed by Mux
- [ ] Verify lesson creation completes successfully with video content
- [ ] Test the complete lesson creation flow with various video formats and sizes

## Priority 2: Stripe Connect Integration

### Issue Description
The Stripe Connect flow appears to complete successfully on Stripe's side, but the application database is not being properly updated. This results in the Stripe Account Status section showing as incomplete when it should be complete.

### Technical Analysis
- The redirect from Stripe back to the application is working
- The database update after successful Stripe onboarding is failing
- This affects creator payouts and the ability to sell lessons

### Action Items
- [ ] Debug the Stripe webhook handling for account updates
- [ ] Verify Stripe Connect API integration is correctly implemented
- [ ] Ensure database updates occur after successful Stripe onboarding
- [ ] Implement better error handling and logging for Stripe Connect flow
- [ ] Add status checks to verify Stripe account status is correctly reflected
- [ ] Test the complete Stripe Connect flow end-to-end
- [ ] Verify international Stripe Connect accounts work properly
- [ ] Implement proper error messaging for users if Stripe Connect fails

## Priority 3: Various Smaller Bugs

### 3.1 Paid Lessons Without Stripe Account

#### Issue Description
Users can currently create paid lessons without having a confirmed Stripe Connect account.

#### Action Items
- [ ] Add validation to prevent setting prices > 0 without a verified Stripe account
- [ ] Display appropriate error messages to guide users to complete Stripe onboarding
- [ ] Test this validation with various user scenarios

### 3.2 Toast Notification Issues

#### Issue Description
Toast notifications don't disappear automatically, leading to a cluttered UI.

#### Action Items
- [ ] Fix toast notification auto-dismiss functionality
- [ ] Ensure all toasts have appropriate timeout settings
- [ ] Test toast behavior across different actions

### 3.3 Header Navigation Issues

#### Issue Description
The header menu doesn't collapse automatically when navigating to a new page.

#### Action Items
- [ ] Fix header collapse behavior on page navigation
- [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness of header
- [ ] Test header behavior across different devices and screen sizes

## Testing Requirements

To ensure launch readiness, the following end-to-end flows must be tested and verified:

1. **Complete Lesson Creation Flow**
   - [ ] Create lesson with title, description, and price
   - [ ] Upload video content successfully
   - [ ] Verify video processing completes
   - [ ] Publish lesson
   - [ ] Verify lesson appears in marketplace

2. **Complete Purchase Flow**
   - [ ] Browse lessons as a student
   - [ ] Purchase a lesson with Stripe
   - [ ] Verify access to purchased content
   - [ ] Verify purchase records in database

3. **Complete Payout Flow**
   - [ ] Verify creator earnings are calculated correctly
   - [ ] Verify Stripe Connect account receives funds
   - [ ] Test international payment scenarios

4. **Error Handling**
   - [ ] Verify appropriate error messages for all failure scenarios
   - [ ] Ensure no unhandled exceptions in production environment

## Environment Verification

Before launch, verify:

- [ ] All required environment variables are set in production
- [ ] Stripe webhook endpoints are correctly configured
- [ ] Mux API keys and configuration are correct
- [ ] Database access and permissions are properly set up
- [ ] No development/testing artifacts remain in production code

## Additional Considerations

- [ ] Perform final security review
- [ ] Verify all API endpoints have proper authentication
- [ ] Check for any performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Ensure all critical user journeys have been tested
- [ ] Prepare monitoring and error tracking for post-launch issues

## Launch Readiness Criteria

The platform will be considered ready for launch when:
1. All Priority 1 and 2 items are resolved
2. At least 90% of Priority 3 items are resolved
3. All core user flows (create, purchase, payout) work end-to-end
4. No critical security issues remain

This checklist will be updated as issues are resolved or new issues are discovered during the pre-launch testing phase.
