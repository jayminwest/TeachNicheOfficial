# Critical Bugs in Lesson Creation Flow - RESOLVED

## Issue ID: ISSUE-2025-03-04-001

## Description
Three critical issues were identified in the lesson creation flow, all of which have now been fixed:

1. **[RESOLVED] Video Uploader Stuck in Initialization**: The Mux video uploader was permanently stuck in a "Preparing Upload..." state, preventing users from uploading videos for their lessons.

2. **[RESOLVED] Authentication Flow Broken**: Users were receiving an "Authentication Required" toast when attempting to create a lesson, with a 404 error in the console:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/sign-in?redirect=%2Flessons%2Fnew&_rsc=11z1u 404 (Not Found)
   ```

3. **[RESOLVED] Blocking Video Processing**: The previous implementation forced users to wait for video processing to complete before the lesson was created, which was a poor user experience. Additionally, paid lessons were missing required Stripe product and price IDs.

## Technical Analysis

### Issue 1: Video Uploader Initialization Failure ✅ FIXED
The uploader was stuck in the loading state showing "Preparing upload..." because:
- The `startUpload` function in `useVideoUpload` was never automatically called on component mount
- There was no error handling for the initial API call failure in the UI
- The API endpoint `/api/mux/upload` may have been failing to respond correctly

**Fixed by:**
- Added a new `initializeUpload` function that's automatically called on component mount
- Added a new 'initializing' state to better represent what's happening
- Improved error handling during initialization
- Separated status messages from error messages
- Added better error reporting for API failures
- Added cache-busting parameters to prevent stale responses
- Implemented a retry count mechanism to track and limit retries
- Enhanced error UI in the VideoUploader component to show clear error messages with retry options

**Implementation Details:**
- Modified `app/hooks/use-video-upload.ts` to add retry tracking and improved error handling
- Updated `app/api/mux/upload/route.ts` to validate response data and provide better error messages
- Enhanced `app/components/ui/video-uploader.tsx` to show appropriate UI based on upload status

### Issue 2: Authentication Flow Issues ✅ FIXED
The authentication issue had multiple components:
- Duplicate authentication checks (client-side with `useAuth()` and server-side with `supabase.auth.getSession()`)
- Problematic redirect URL construction causing a 404 error
- Inconsistent authentication state between initial page load and form submission

**Fixed by:**
- Fixed profile fetching to use the correct endpoint (`/api/profile/get?userId=`) instead of `/api/profile`
- Improved error handling in the profile fetching process
- Added better error messages for authentication and Stripe verification failures
- Enhanced error recovery to prevent blocking the user experience

**Implementation Details:**
- Updated `app/lessons/new/page.tsx` to use the correct profile endpoint and improve error handling
- Added proper error handling for Stripe account verification
- Implemented more robust error recovery to prevent blocking the user flow

### Issue 3: Blocking Video Processing & Missing Stripe Integration ✅ FIXED
- The previous implementation in `lessons/new/page.tsx` blocked lesson creation until video processing was complete
- For paid lessons, the code needed to create the required Stripe product and price IDs
- The lesson should be created in a "processing" state while the video processes in the background

**Fixed by:**
- Created a new API endpoint for background video processing (`app/api/lessons/process-video/route.ts`)
- Updated lesson creation flow to create lessons immediately with "processing" status
- Implemented background processing for videos
- Ensured Stripe product/price creation for paid lessons
- Improved user experience with appropriate loading states and feedback
- Added an `isPaid` flag to the background processing request to handle Stripe integration

**Implementation Details:**
- Created a new API endpoint at `app/api/lessons/process-video/route.ts` that handles:
  - Video processing in the background without blocking the user experience
  - Stripe product and price creation for paid lessons
  - Comprehensive authorization checks
  - Detailed error handling and logging
- Updated `app/lessons/new/page.tsx` to implement non-blocking lesson creation
- Added proper error handling and user feedback throughout the process

## Affected Files

The following files were modified to fix these issues:

1. `/app/lessons/new/page.tsx` - Updated to implement non-blocking video processing and fix authentication issues
2. `/app/components/ui/video-uploader.tsx` - Enhanced with better error handling and UI states
3. `/app/hooks/use-video-upload.ts` - Fixed initialization process and improved error handling
4. `/app/api/mux/upload/route.ts` - Added response validation and better error reporting
5. `/app/api/lessons/process-video/route.ts` - New endpoint created for background video processing

Additional files that were indirectly affected:
- `/app/api/lessons/route.ts` - Now works with the new processing flow

## Verification Steps

All issues have been fixed and can be verified with the following steps:

### Video Uploader Fix:
1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to `/lessons/new`
3. Observe that the video uploader automatically initializes
4. If there's an error, a clear error message is shown with a retry option
5. Upload progress is accurately displayed during the upload process

### Authentication Fix:
1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to `/lessons/new`
3. Fill out the lesson form
4. Click the submit button
5. Observe that the form submits without authentication errors
6. No 404 errors appear in the console

### Non-Blocking Video Processing & Stripe Integration:
1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to `/lessons/new`
3. Upload a video
4. Fill out the form with a price > 0
5. Submit the form
6. Observe that the lesson is created immediately and you're redirected to the lesson page
7. The lesson shows a "processing" state while the video processes in the background
8. Check database - paid lessons now have stripe_product_id and stripe_price_id after processing completes

## Root Causes and Solutions

### Video Uploader:
- **Root Cause**: No automatic initialization of the upload URL and missing error handling
- **Solution**: Implemented automatic initialization with retry logic, added comprehensive error handling, and improved the UI to show clear error states with recovery options

### Authentication:
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect profile endpoint and inadequate error handling
- **Solution**: Updated to use the correct profile endpoint with proper error handling and recovery mechanisms

### Blocking Video Processing & Missing Stripe IDs:
- **Root Cause**: Synchronous video processing and missing Stripe integration
- **Solution**: Implemented background processing with a dedicated API endpoint, added Stripe product/price creation for paid lessons, and improved the overall user experience

## Implemented Solutions

### For Video Uploader Issue:
1. Enhanced the `useVideoUpload` hook with:
   - Automatic initialization on component mount
   - Comprehensive error handling with retry logic
   - Cache-busting to prevent stale responses
   - Clear status tracking and error reporting

2. Improved the `VideoUploader` component with:
   - Better UI states for different upload stages
   - Clear error messages with retry options
   - Improved progress reporting

3. Fixed the `/api/mux/upload` endpoint with:
   - Proper response validation
   - Detailed error reporting
   - Improved error handling

### For Authentication Issue:

   - Fixed the endpoint to use `/api/profile/get?userId=` instead of `/api/profile`
   - Added proper error handling for profile fetching
   - Improved error recovery to prevent blocking the user experience

### For Blocking Video Processing & Missing Stripe IDs:
1. Created a new API endpoint at `/api/lessons/process-video/route.ts` that:
   - Processes videos in the background
   - Creates Stripe products and prices for paid lessons
   - Updates the lesson status when processing completes
   - Implements proper authorization and error handling

2. Updated the lesson creation flow to:
   - Create lessons immediately with "processing" status
   - Start background processing without blocking the user
   - Provide appropriate feedback during the process
