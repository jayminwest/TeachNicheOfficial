# Project Cleanup and Stabilization

## Description
The project requires significant cleanup and stabilization to ensure all core features are working properly. Currently, there are issues with authentication, excessive e2e tests, and database communication. We need to trim unnecessary components and focus on getting the existing features into a working, tested condition using the simplest approach possible.

## Progress Summary
- âœ… Created centralized database service with error handling and retry logic
- âœ… Implemented entity-specific services for lessons and purchases
- âœ… Simplified authentication context and extracted profile management
- âœ… Created custom hooks for data fetching
- âœ… Refactored key components to use new services
- âœ… Added authentication test helpers for E2E tests
- ðŸ”„ In progress: Updating remaining components
- ðŸ”„ In progress: Optimizing test suite

## Technical Analysis
Based on the codebase review, several areas need immediate attention:

1. **Authentication System**:
   - âœ… The current auth implementation in `AuthContext.tsx` is overly complex with multiple nested state updates
   - âœ… `signInWithGoogle()` in `supabaseAuth.ts` has complex redirect handling that could be simplified
   - âœ… Error handling is inconsistent across authentication flows
   - âœ… Profile creation logic is embedded in the auth context rather than separated as a service

2. **Database Communication**:
   - âœ… Direct Supabase client calls scattered throughout components (e.g., in `lessons/page.tsx`)
   - âœ… No abstraction layer for common database operations
   - âœ… Inconsistent error handling for database operations
   - âœ… Missing retry logic for potentially flaky operations

3. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - âœ… E2E tests like `lesson-purchase.spec.ts` contain complex mocking that's difficult to maintain
   - âœ… Login flow in e2e tests is brittle and could fail with minor UI changes
   - ðŸ”„ Tests rely on specific test IDs that must be maintained across UI changes

4. **Component Structure**:
   - âœ… Components like `sign-in.tsx` mix authentication logic with UI rendering
   - ðŸ”„ Lesson-related components have duplicated code for fetching and displaying lessons
   - ðŸ”„ Inconsistent prop interfaces across similar components

## Files Requiring Updates

## Testing Strategy

### E2E Tests to Keep âœ…
1. **Core User Journey Tests**:
   - User registration and login flow
   - Lesson browsing and viewing
   - Lesson purchase flow
   - Instructor lesson creation

2. **Critical Business Logic Tests**:
   - Payment processing verification
   - Access control for purchased content
   - Instructor payout verification

### E2E Tests to Remove or Simplify ðŸ”„
1. **Redundant Authentication Tests**:
   - Multiple variations of login/signup that test the same paths
   - Tests that verify UI details rather than functionality

2. **Non-Critical Feature Tests**:
   - Profile customization tests (can be unit tested instead)
   - Comment/rating tests (can be unit tested instead)
   - Admin-only features that aren't core to the user experience

3. **Overly Complex Tests**:
   - Tests with excessive mocking that are difficult to maintain
   - Tests that depend on specific UI implementation details

### Service Unit Tests to Add ðŸ”„
1. **Database Service Tests**:
   - Test CRUD operations for each entity
   - Verify error handling and retry logic
   - Test data integrity constraints

2. **Authentication Service Tests**:
   - Test authentication methods
   - Verify error handling
   - Test auth state management

### Client-Side Unit Tests to Add ðŸ”„
1. **Custom Hooks Tests**:
   - Test data fetching hooks
   - Verify error handling
   - Test loading states
   - Test data transformations

2. **Component Logic Tests**:
   - Test form validation
   - Test state management
   - Test conditional rendering logic
   - Test loading and error states

## Weekly Review Checkpoints

### Week 1 Review âœ…
- [x] Database service implementation complete
- [x] Initial authentication refactoring complete
- [x] At least 2-3 components updated to use new services
- [ ] Unit tests for database service passing

### Week 2 Review ðŸ”„
- [ ] Component refactoring complete
- [x] Custom hooks implemented
- [x] Authentication flow fully refactored
- [x] E2E test helpers created

### Week 3 Review ðŸ”„
- [ ] All E2E tests refactored or removed as planned
- [ ] All components using consistent patterns
- [ ] Full test coverage for critical paths
- [x] Documentation updated to reflect new architecture

## Completion Criteria
- All tracked items in the progress tracking section are complete
- Authentication flows work consistently across all paths
- Database operations are centralized through the database service
- E2E tests cover all critical user journeys without redundancy
- Unit tests provide adequate coverage for core services
- All components use consistent patterns for data fetching and error handling

## Next Steps
1. Complete the refactoring of remaining lesson components
2. Implement unit tests for database services and hooks
3. Refactor purchase-related components
4. Optimize and clean up the test suite
5. Document the new architecture and patterns

## Additional Context
This cleanup is critical for project stability and should be approached with a focus on simplicity and reliability rather than adding new features. The goal is to have a stable, working product with the existing feature set properly implemented and tested.
