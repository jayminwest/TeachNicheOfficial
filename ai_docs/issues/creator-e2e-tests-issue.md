# Feature: Add E2E Tests for Creator Functionality

## Issue Description

Our platform requires comprehensive end-to-end (E2E) testing for creator functionality to ensure reliability and quality before launch. Currently, we have tests for lesson purchase flows, but creator-specific journeys remain untested. We need to establish E2E tests that:

1. Verify creator onboarding and profile setup
2. Test content creation and management workflows
3. Validate payment receipt and analytics functionality
4. Ensure proper functioning of creator dashboard features
5. Test integration with Stripe Connect for payouts

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up test fixtures for creator accounts with Stripe Connect integration
2. Create E2E tests for creator onboarding journey
3. Implement tests for lesson creation and management
4. Add tests for creator analytics dashboard
5. Test payment receipt and reporting functionality
6. Verify proper permissions and access controls

## Expected Behavior

- Tests should verify successful creator account setup
- Content creation workflows should be fully tested
- Tests should validate that creators can view analytics data
- Payment receipt and reporting should be verified
- Tests should run across multiple browsers
- All tests should integrate with our existing Playwright setup

## Technical Analysis

The E2E testing for creator functionality requires:

1. Test accounts with creator privileges
2. Mocked Stripe Connect integration for testing
3. Test data generation for analytics testing
4. Verification of video upload and processing
5. Testing of creator-specific UI components

## Potential Implementation Approach

1. Creator Account Setup Tests:
   - Test profile creation and editing
   - Verify Stripe Connect onboarding flow
   - Test creator settings management

2. Content Management Tests:
   - Test lesson creation workflow
   - Verify video upload functionality
   - Test lesson editing and publishing
   - Verify content organization features

3. Analytics Tests:
   - Test dashboard data loading and display
   - Verify metrics calculations
   - Test date range filtering
   - Verify chart and graph functionality

4. Payment Tests:
   - Test payment receipt verification
   - Verify payout scheduling
   - Test payment history display
   - Verify transaction reporting

## Likely Affected Files

1. `e2e-tests/creator/` - Create new directory for creator tests
2. `e2e-tests/creator/onboarding.spec.ts` - Creator onboarding tests
3. `e2e-tests/creator/content-management.spec.ts` - Content creation tests
4. `e2e-tests/creator/analytics.spec.ts` - Analytics dashboard tests
5. `e2e-tests/creator/payments.spec.ts` - Payment and payout tests
6. `e2e-tests/fixtures/creator-user.ts` - Test fixtures for creator accounts

## Testing Requirements

- Verify tests run successfully across all target browsers
- Ensure tests are reliable and not flaky
- Confirm proper test isolation to prevent interference
- Verify mocked services work correctly
- Test with different creator account states (new, established)
- Ensure proper cleanup of test data

## Environment

- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Devices**: Desktop, Tablet, Mobile
- **CI System**: GitHub Actions
- **Testing Framework**: Playwright
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe Connect

## Priority

High - Comprehensive E2E testing for creator functionality is critical for ensuring platform reliability and quality before launch, especially given our current low test coverage for creator features.

## Additional Context

- Creator functionality represents a core part of our platform
- Special attention should be paid to Stripe Connect integration testing
- Consider implementing visual testing for creator dashboard components
- Tests should verify proper error handling for failed uploads or payments
- Documentation for the test implementation should be included
