## Status Summary
- [ ] Core documentation updated to reflect actual project status
- [ ] Component patterns documented
- [ ] API route patterns documented
- [ ] Authentication flow documented
- [ ] Database access patterns documented
- [ ] Testing approach documented
- [ ] AI tool guidance created

## Detailed Progress

### Core Documentation Files

#### 1. ai_docs/core/OVERVIEW.md
- [ ] Update project status to reflect actual application status
- [ ] Update tech stack with specific versions from package.json
- [ ] Review and update version history
- [ ] Update target audience section
- [ ] Update project goals to reflect current direction

**Inconsistencies to address:**
- Document dates need review
- Project description may need updating
- Tech stack details need verification

#### 2. ai_docs/core/ARCHITECTURE.md
- [ ] Update system architecture to reflect actual implementation
- [ ] Add concrete examples of component patterns
- [ ] Document API route patterns
- [ ] Update security architecture section
- [ ] Update testing architecture section

**Inconsistencies to address:**
- Architecture description may need verification against actual implementation
- Examples from codebase should be added
- Testing section needs alignment with actual practices

#### 3. ai_docs/core/DOCUMENTATION_USAGE.md
- [ ] Update to reflect how documentation should be used with the codebase
- [ ] Add sections for AI tools to understand codebase patterns
- [ ] Review and update version history

**Inconsistencies to address:**
- Dates need review
- May need additional sections for AI tool usage

## Implementation Notes
- When updating documentation, ensure language accurately reflects the project's current state
- Replace hypothetical examples with actual code examples where possible
- Review all dates for accuracy
- Ensure consistency in terminology across all documentation files

## Completed Updates
*This section will be populated as updates are completed*

## Next Steps
1. Review core documentation files to understand current state
2. Examine codebase to identify actual patterns in use
3. Update core documentation files first
4. Create new pattern documentation files as needed
5. Test documentation with AI tools to verify effectiveness
