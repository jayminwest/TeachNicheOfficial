# Documentation Update Progress Tracker

## Overview
This file tracks the progress of updating the AI documentation to accurately reflect the current status of Teach Niche and its codebase patterns. This tracker will help ensure all necessary updates are completed systematically and consistently.

## Status Summary
- [x] Core documentation updated to reflect actual project status
- [ ] Component patterns documented
- [x] API route patterns documented
- [ ] Authentication flow documented
- [x] Database access patterns documented
- [x] Testing approach documented
- [ ] AI tool guidance created

## Detailed Progress

### Core Documentation Files

#### 1. ai_docs/core/OVERVIEW.md
- [x] Update project status to reflect actual application status
- [x] Update tech stack with specific versions from package.json
- [x] Review and update version history
- [x] Update target audience section
- [x] Update project goals to reflect current direction

**Inconsistencies to address:**
- Document dates need review
- Project description may need updating
- Tech stack details need verification

#### 2. ai_docs/core/ARCHITECTURE.md
- [x] Update system architecture to reflect actual implementation
- [x] Add concrete examples of component patterns
- [x] Document API route patterns
- [x] Update security architecture section
- [x] Update testing architecture section

**Inconsistencies to address:**
- Architecture description may need verification against actual implementation
- Examples from codebase should be added
- Testing section needs alignment with actual practices

#### 3. ai_docs/core/DOCUMENTATION_USAGE.md
- [ ] Update to reflect how documentation should be used with the codebase
- [ ] Add sections for AI tools to understand codebase patterns
- [ ] Review and update version history

**Inconsistencies to address:**
- Dates need review
- May need additional sections for AI tool usage

### New Documentation Files to Consider

#### 1. ai_docs/patterns/COMPONENTS.md
- [ ] Document component patterns
- [ ] Document TypeScript interface patterns for props
- [ ] Document component styling approaches
- [ ] Include examples from actual codebase

#### 2. ai_docs/patterns/API_ROUTES.md
- [ ] Document API organization
- [ ] Document response formatting
- [ ] Document error handling patterns
- [ ] Document API conventions
- [ ] Include examples from actual codebase

#### 3. ai_docs/patterns/AUTHENTICATION.md
- [ ] Document authentication implementation
- [ ] Document authentication flow
- [ ] Document protected content implementation
- [ ] Include examples from actual codebase

#### 4. ai_docs/patterns/DATABASE.md
- [x] Document database access patterns
- [x] Document security implementations
- [x] Document error handling
- [x] Include examples from actual codebase

#### 5. ai_docs/patterns/TESTING.md
- [x] Document testing approaches
- [x] Document test organization
- [x] Document mock implementations
- [x] Include examples from actual codebase

#### 6. ai_docs/guides/AI_TOOLS.md
- [ ] Create guide for AI tools to understand codebase

- [ ] Provide examples of effective AI prompts

## Implementation Notes
- When updating documentation, ensure language accurately reflects the project's current state
- Replace hypothetical examples with actual code examples where possible
- Review all dates for accuracy
- Ensure consistency in terminology across all documentation files

## Completed Updates
- March 5, 2025: Updated core documentation files (OVERVIEW.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, GLOSSARY.md, GETTING_STARTED.md) with actual implementation details
- March 5, 2025: Added concrete examples from codebase to ARCHITECTURE.md
- March 5, 2025: Updated database access patterns documentation with DatabaseService pattern
- March 5, 2025: Updated testing approach documentation with actual testing patterns

## Next Steps
1. Review core documentation files to understand current state
2. Examine codebase to identify actual patterns in use
3. Update core documentation files first
4. Create new pattern documentation files as needed
5. Test documentation with AI tools to verify effectiveness
