# Feature Planning Template

## 1. Initial Analysis

### Core Requirements
- [ ] Feature purpose and goals
- [ ] User stories/requirements
- [ ] Success criteria
- [ ] Priority level

### Technical Scope
- [ ] Affected system areas (UI/API/DB/Auth/Payment)
- [ ] Integration points
- [ ] Data requirements
- [ ] Security considerations

### Complexity Assessment
```typescript
interface ComplexityAssessment {
  level: 'simple' | 'medium' | 'complex';
  factors: {
    ui: boolean;
    state: boolean;
    api: boolean;
    db: boolean;
    auth: boolean;
    payment: boolean;
  };
  effort: 'minimal lift' | 'moderate lift' | 'significant lift';
  scope: {
    size: 'focused' | 'broad' | 'system-wide';     // How many areas this touches
    impact: 'additive' | 'modifying' | 'breaking';  // How it affects existing code
    risk: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';               // Potential for issues
  };
}
```

## 2. Architecture Planning

### Component Structure
- [ ] Atomic design level (atom/molecule/organism)
- [ ] Required props and interfaces
- [ ] State management needs
- [ ] Reuse opportunities

### Data Flow
- [ ] Data sources
- [ ] API endpoints needed
- [ ] State management approach
- [ ] Caching requirements

### Integration Points
- [ ] External services (Stripe/Mux/etc)
- [ ] Internal services
- [ ] Authentication requirements
- [ ] API contracts

## 3. Implementation Strategy

### UI Components
- [ ] Shadcn UI components needed
- [ ] Custom components required
- [ ] Accessibility requirements
- [ ] Responsive design needs

### Testing Strategy
```typescript
interface TestingStrategy {
  unit: string[];
  integration: string[];
  e2e: string[];
  performance: string[];
}
```

### Security Considerations
- [ ] Authentication requirements
- [ ] Authorization rules
- [ ] Data validation needs
- [ ] Security testing approach

## 4. Quality Assurance

### Performance Requirements

- [ ] Bundle size impact
- [ ] API response times
- [ ] Animation performance

### Testing Coverage
- [ ] Unit test scenarios
- [ ] Integration test cases
- [ ] E2E test flows
- [ ] Performance test cases

### Documentation Needs
- [ ] Component documentation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Usage examples
- [ ] Configuration guide

## 5. Deployment Planning

### Environment Requirements
- [ ] Environment variables
- [ ] Service configurations
- [ ] Database changes
- [ ] API updates

### Release Strategy
- [ ] Deployment approach
- [ ] Feature flags needed
- [ ] Rollback plan
- [ ] Monitoring requirements

## 6. Post-Implementation

### Monitoring
- [ ] Performance metrics
- [ ] Error tracking
- [ ] Usage analytics
- [ ] User feedback

### Maintenance
- [ ] Update frequency
- [ ] Deprecation plan
- [ ] Version compatibility
- [ ] Support requirements

## Example Usage

```typescript
const featurePlan = {
  name: "Video Upload Component",
  complexity: {
    level: "medium",
    factors: {
      ui: true,
      state: true,
      api: true,
      db: false,
      auth: true,
      payment: false
    },
    effort: "moderate lift",
    scope: {
      size: "focused",      // Single feature area
      impact: "additive",   // Adds new functionality
      risk: "low"          // Well-understood integration
    }
  },
  components: [
    {
      name: "UploadButton",
      type: "atom",
      reusable: true
    },
    {
      name: "ProgressBar",
      type: "atom",
      reusable: true
    },
    {
      name: "VideoUploader",
      type: "molecule",
      reusable: true
    }
  ],
  testing: {
    unit: [
      "Upload button states",
      "Progress calculation",
      "Error handling"
    ],
    integration: [
      "Mux API integration",
      "Upload workflow"
    ],
    e2e: [
      "Complete upload flow"
    ],
    performance: [
      "Large file handling",
      "Concurrent uploads"
    ]
  }
};
```
