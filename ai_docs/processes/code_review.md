# Code Review Process

This document outlines the code review process for the Teach Niche platform, with an emphasis on our Test Driven Development (TDD) approach and third-party API integrations.

## Code Review Principles

### Core Values

1. **Quality**: Ensure code meets our quality standards
2. **Knowledge Sharing**: Share knowledge and best practices
3. **Collaboration**: Work together to improve the codebase
4. **Mentorship**: Help team members grow and improve
5. **Verification**: Confirm that tests were written before implementation (TDD)

### Review Mindset

- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Acknowledge good work and improvements

## Review Process

### Before Submitting for Review

As a developer, before submitting your code for review:

1. **Verify TDD Approach**:
   - Ensure tests were written before implementation
   - Confirm all tests pass
   - Check test coverage for new code

2. **Self-Review**:
   - Review your own code first
   - Check for obvious issues
   - Ensure code meets standards
   - Verify third-party API integration tests

3. **Prepare the Pull Request**:
   - Write a clear description
   - Link to relevant issues
   - Highlight key changes
   - Note any third-party API interactions
   - Explain testing approach

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. Create a pull request from your feature branch to the dev branch
2. Fill out the pull request template completely
3. Assign appropriate reviewers
4. Add relevant labels

### Reviewing Code

As a reviewer:

1. **Verify TDD Approach**:
   - Check commit history to confirm tests were written first
   - Verify tests are comprehensive and cover edge cases
   - Ensure third-party API integrations are properly tested

2. **Review Tests**:
   - Review test code first
   - Verify test quality and coverage
   - Check for proper mocking and test data management
   - Ensure third-party API tests follow progressive approach

3. **Review Implementation**:
   - Check code quality and adherence to standards
   - Verify functionality meets requirements
   - Look for security issues
   - Check for performance concerns
   - Verify error handling, especially for third-party APIs

4. **Provide Feedback**:
   - Be specific and actionable
   - Explain reasoning behind suggestions
   - Differentiate between required changes and suggestions
   - Acknowledge good work

### Addressing Feedback

As a developer receiving feedback:

1. Respond to all comments
2. Make requested changes or explain why not
3. Request re-review when changes are complete
4. Thank reviewers for their input

### Approving and Merging

1. **Approval Requirements**:
   - At least one approval from a team member
   - All required changes addressed
   - All tests passing
   - CI/CD checks passing

2. **Merging Process**:
   - Squash and merge to keep history clean
   - Use a clear, descriptive merge commit message
   - Delete the branch after merging

## TDD Verification Checklist

When reviewing code, verify the following TDD-related items:

### Test-First Development

- [ ] Tests were committed before implementation code
- [ ] Tests initially failed (Red phase)
- [ ] Implementation made tests pass (Green phase)
- [ ] Code was refactored while maintaining passing tests (Refactor phase)

### Test Quality

- [ ] Tests are comprehensive and cover edge cases
- [ ] Tests are readable and maintainable
- [ ] Tests use appropriate assertions
- [ ] Tests are independent and don't rely on global state
- [ ] Tests include proper setup and teardown

### Third-Party API Testing

- [ ] Basic functionality is tested with mocked responses
- [ ] Tests with actual API calls are included where appropriate
- [ ] Error handling is tested
- [ ] Edge cases are covered
- [ ] Test data is properly managed and cleaned up

## Code Quality Checklist

### General

- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Code is readable and maintainable
- [ ] Functions and components have a single responsibility
- [ ] No duplicate code
- [ ] No unnecessary comments
- [ ] Proper error handling

### TypeScript

- [ ] Proper types are used
- [ ] No use of `any` type without justification
- [ ] Interfaces and types are well-defined
- [ ] Generic types are used appropriately

### React Components

- [ ] Components follow project structure
- [ ] Props are properly typed
- [ ] Components are properly tested
- [ ] UI is accessible
- [ ] Performance considerations are addressed

### API Endpoints

- [ ] Proper input validation
- [ ] Appropriate error handling
- [ ] Authentication and authorization checks
- [ ] Efficient database queries
- [ ] Proper HTTP status codes

### Third-Party Integrations

- [ ] API keys and secrets are properly handled
- [ ] Error handling for API failures
- [ ] Rate limiting considerations
- [ ] Proper logging for debugging
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms for API unavailability

## Example Review Comments

### Positive Feedback

```
Great job following the TDD approach! I can see from the commit history that you wrote the tests first, and the tests are comprehensive.

The way you've structured the Stripe integration tests with both mocked and actual API tests is excellent. This gives us confidence that the integration works correctly.

I particularly like how you've handled error cases for the payment processing.
```

### Constructive Feedback

```
I notice the tests for the Supabase integration were committed after the implementation. Remember our TDD approach requires writing tests first. Could you explain your approach here?

The mocked tests look good, but I don't see any tests using the actual Stripe API. We should add these to verify the integration works correctly in a real environment.

The error handling for API failures could be improved. Consider adding specific error types and more descriptive error messages to help with debugging.
```

### Specific Suggestions

```
In the payment processing function, you're not handling the case where the Stripe API returns a card_declined error. We should add a specific error message for this case.

The test for the Mux video upload doesn't clean up the test asset after the test. This could lead to accumulated test data. Consider adding cleanup in an afterEach or afterAll block.

The Supabase query could be more efficient by selecting only the fields you need instead of using select('*'). This would reduce data transfer and improve performance.
```

## Review Examples

### Example 1: New Feature with Third-Party Integration

```markdown
## PR: Add Stripe Payment Processing

### TDD Verification
✅ Tests were written before implementation (commits show test files added first)
✅ Tests cover both happy path and error cases
✅ Both mocked and actual API tests are included
✅ Test data is properly cleaned up

### Code Quality
✅ Code follows project standards
✅ Error handling is comprehensive
✅ Types are well-defined
✅ Documentation is clear

### Suggestions
- Consider adding a retry mechanism for transient Stripe errors
- The webhook handling could use more specific error messages
- Add a comment explaining the fee calculation logic

Overall, excellent work! The progressive testing approach with both mocked and actual API tests gives us confidence in the implementation.
```

### Example 2: Bug Fix with API Integration

```markdown
## PR: Fix Supabase Authentication Issue

### TDD Verification
❌ Tests were not written before the fix (please explain approach)
✅ Tests cover the specific issue and regression cases
❓ No actual API tests included (needed for auth fix)

### Code Quality
✅ Fix is focused and minimal
✅ Error handling is improved
✅ Types are consistent

### Required Changes
- Add tests with actual Supabase API to verify the fix works in a real environment
- Improve error message for failed authentication

The fix looks good, but we need to ensure it works with the actual Supabase API. Please add integration tests that verify the fix with the test environment.
```
