# Stripe Testing Plan

## 1. Completed Tests ✓

### A. Stripe Connect Button Tests ✓
All tests implemented in `__tests__/components/ui/stripe-connect-button.test.tsx`:
- ✓ renders connect button when not connected
- ✓ renders disabled button when already connected
- ✓ renders sign in message when user is not authenticated
- ✓ shows loading state while connecting
- ✓ handles API errors appropriately
- ✓ handles missing session appropriately
- ✓ handles session error appropriately
- ✓ initiates oauth flow when clicked
- ✓ updates UI after successful connection

### B. Checkout Flow Tests ✓
All tests implemented in `__tests__/payment/checkout.test.tsx`:
- ✓ creates checkout session successfully
- ✓ redirects to Stripe Checkout
- ✓ handles successful payment completion
- ✓ handles cancelled payment appropriately
- ✓ handles invalid price errors
- ✓ handles network failures
- ✓ handles session creation failures

## 2. Remaining Tests

### A. Webhook Testing
```typescript
describe('Stripe Webhooks', () => {
  it('processes successful payment webhooks')
  it('handles refund webhooks')
  it('manages subscription lifecycle events')
  it('validates webhook signatures')
});
```

### B. Integration Tests
```typescript
describe('Payment Integration', () => {
  it('completes full payment flow')
  it('handles international payments correctly')
});
```

### C. Error Scenarios Still to Test
- Invalid card numbers
- Insufficient funds
- 3D Secure authentication failures
- Currency conversion issues
- Account verification failures
- Webhook signature mismatches

## 3. Test Environment & CI Setup
- Add Stripe-related test jobs to CI pipeline
- Configure test mode keys in CI environment
- Setup integration tests in staging

## 4. Testing Infrastructure
✓ Mock Setup (stripe-mocks.ts)
✓ Test Utilities (test-utils.tsx)
✓ Environment Variables

## 5. Best Practices to Follow
- Use Stripe test mode and test cards
- Mock external Stripe API calls in unit tests
- Use real API calls in integration tests
- Test both successful and failure scenarios
- Verify webhook signature validation
- Test currency handling and conversions
- Ensure proper error messages are displayed to users
