# Security Standards

This document outlines the security standards and best practices for the Teach Niche platform.

## General Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Grant only the minimum necessary access
3. **Secure by Default**: Systems should be secure in their default configuration
4. **Fail Securely**: Errors should not compromise security
5. **Complete Mediation**: Verify every access attempt
6. **Separation of Duties**: Critical actions require multiple approvals
7. **Security by Design**: Security is considered from the beginning

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Standards

- Use Supabase Auth for user authentication
- Implement multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- Enforce strong password policies
- Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- Use secure session management
- Implement proper logout functionality

### Authorization Standards

- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Verify authorization on every request
- Use middleware for consistent authorization checks
- Implement proper access controls for API endpoints
- Regularly audit access control configurations

## Data Security

### Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Implement proper database access controls
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement data classification and handling procedures
- Regularly backup critical data

### Payment and Financial Data Security

- Never store credit card numbers
- Use Stripe Elements for secure payment collection
- Store only bank account tokens, not actual account numbers
- Implement strict access controls for financial data
- Log all financial transactions for audit purposes
- Regularly reconcile financial records
- Implement fraud detection measures

## API Security

### API Protection

- Implement rate limiting
- Use CSRF protection for all state-changing operations
- Validate all input data
- Implement proper error handling
- Use secure HTTP headers
- Document security requirements for all endpoints

### Webhook Security

- Verify webhook signatures
- Implement idempotency for webhook processing
- Log all webhook events
- Implement proper error handling for webhooks

## Infrastructure Security

### Server Security

- Keep all systems updated with security patches
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Use secure configuration for all services
- Implement intrusion detection
- Regularly scan for vulnerabilities
- Use secure deployment practices

### Cloud Security

- Follow the principle of least privilege for cloud resources
- Use secure configuration for all cloud services
- Implement proper network segmentation
- Regularly audit cloud resource access
- Use encryption for cloud storage
- Implement proper backup and disaster recovery

## Security Testing

### Testing Requirements

- Conduct regular security testing
- Implement automated security scanning
- Perform manual penetration testing
- Test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Include security scenarios in end-to-end tests
- Verify security fixes with regression tests

### Security Review Process

- Conduct security reviews for all major changes
- Include security considerations in code reviews
- Document security decisions and trade-offs
- Regularly review security configurations
- Conduct threat modeling for new features

## Incident Response

### Response Procedures

- Document incident response procedures
- Define roles and responsibilities
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Establish communication channels
- Practice incident response scenarios
- Document lessons learned from incidents

## Compliance

### Regulatory Requirements

- Comply with relevant data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Implement proper data retention policies
- Provide mechanisms for data subject rights
- Maintain records of processing activities
- Conduct regular compliance audits

## Security Documentation

### Documentation Requirements

- Document security architecture
- Maintain up-to-date security policies
- Document security controls
- Provide security guidelines for developers
- Document security testing procedures
- Maintain security incident records
