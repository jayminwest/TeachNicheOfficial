# Testing Standards

This document outlines the testing standards and best practices for the Teach Niche platform.

## Testing Pyramid

Our testing strategy follows the testing pyramid approach:

1. **Unit Tests** (Base): Test individual functions and components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests** (Middle): Test interactions between components
3. **End-to-End Tests** (Top): Test complete user journeys

## Test Coverage Requirements

- **Overall Coverage Target**: >80%
- **Critical Components**: >90%
- **API Routes**: 100%
- **Authentication Flows**: 100%
- **Payment Processing**: 100%

## End-to-End Testing with Playwright

### Setup and Configuration

- Use Playwright for all E2E testing
- Configure tests to run on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Include mobile viewport testing
- Set up visual regression testing for UI components

### Test Organization

Organize tests by user journey:

```
e2e-tests/
├── auth/
│   ├── sign-in.spec.ts
│   ├── sign-up.spec.ts
│   └── password-reset.spec.ts
├── lessons/
│   ├── browse-lessons.spec.ts
│   ├── purchase-lesson.spec.ts
│   └── view-lesson.spec.ts
├── creator/
│   ├── upload-video.spec.ts
│   ├── manage-lessons.spec.ts
│   └── stripe-connect.spec.ts
├── profile/
│   ├── update-profile.spec.ts
│   └── manage-payments.spec.ts
├── fixtures/
│   ├── auth.fixture.ts
│   ├── lesson.fixture.ts
│   └── user.fixture.ts
└── utils/
    ├── test-helpers.ts
    └── mock-data.ts
```

### Test Naming Conventions

- Test files: `feature-name.spec.ts`
- Test descriptions: Should clearly describe the behavior being tested
- Use the format: `describe('Component/Feature', () => { test('should behave in a certain way', async () => {...}) })`

### Test Data Management

- Use fixtures for test data setup and teardown
- Isolate test data to prevent test interference
- Clean up test data after tests complete
- Use unique identifiers for test data to prevent collisions

### Authentication in Tests

- Create test users with specific roles
- Use authentication fixtures to simplify login/logout
- Test both authenticated and unauthenticated states
- Verify proper access controls

### Visual Regression Testing

- Capture screenshots for critical UI components
- Compare screenshots against baseline images
- Set tolerance levels for acceptable differences
- Document expected visual changes

## Unit and Integration Testing

### React Component Testing

- Test component rendering
- Test component props and state
- Test user interactions
- Test error states and loading states

### API Testing

- Test successful responses
- Test error handling
- Test validation
- Test authentication and authorization

### Hook Testing

- Test hook initialization
- Test hook state changes
- Test hook side effects
- Test hook cleanup

## Test-Driven Development

When implementing new features:

1. Write failing tests first
2. Implement the minimum code to pass tests
3. Refactor while keeping tests passing

## CI Integration

- Run unit and integration tests on all PRs
- Run E2E tests on PRs to protected branches
- Block merges if tests fail
- Generate and publish test reports

## Flaky Test Management

- Mark known flaky tests with `@flaky` tag
- Set up retry logic for flaky tests
- Track and prioritize fixing flaky tests
- Document workarounds for known issues

## Performance Testing

- Set up performance testing for critical paths
- Establish performance baselines
- Monitor performance regressions
- Test under various network conditions

## Accessibility Testing

- Include accessibility checks in E2E tests
- Verify WCAG compliance
- Test with screen readers
- Check keyboard navigation

## Security Testing

- Test authentication flows
- Test authorization rules
- Test input validation
- Test against common vulnerabilities

## Test Documentation

- Document test setup procedures
- Document test data requirements
- Document known limitations
- Keep test documentation up to date
