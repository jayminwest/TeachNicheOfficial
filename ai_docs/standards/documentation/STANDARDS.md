# Documentation Standards

This document outlines the standards and best practices for all documentation in the Teach Niche project. Following these guidelines ensures consistency, clarity, and usability across our documentation.

## File Naming Conventions

- Use UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.md for all documentation files
- Use lowercase for directories
- Group related documents in subdirectories
- Use clear, descriptive names that indicate content

## Document Structure

### Header Format

All documentation files should begin with:

```markdown
# Document Title

Brief description of the document's purpose and scope.

## Overview

A more detailed explanation of what this document covers and why it matters.
```

### Section Headers

- Use ## for main sections
- Use ### for subsections
- Use #### for sub-subsections
- Avoid going deeper than 4 levels of headers

### Content Organization

- Start with the most important information
- Use bullet points for lists of items
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Include code examples in appropriate code blocks
- Use tables for structured data

## Writing Style

### Voice and Tone

- Use clear, direct language
- Write in present tense
- Use active voice
- Be concise but complete
- Avoid jargon unless necessary

### Formatting

- Use **bold** for emphasis
- Use *italics* for introduced terms
- Use `code formatting` for code, commands, and file names
- Use > blockquotes for important notes or quotes

## Code Examples

- Always specify the language for syntax highlighting
- Keep examples concise and focused
- Include comments for complex code
- Ensure examples are correct and tested

```typescript
// Good example with proper formatting
function exampleFunction(param: string): boolean {
  // This comment explains the purpose
  return param.length > 0;
}
```

## Links and References

- Use relative links for internal documentation
- Use descriptive link text
- Include version numbers for external references
- Verify all links work

## Images and Diagrams

- Include alt text for all images
- Keep diagrams simple and focused
- Use consistent styling for diagrams
- Optimize image sizes for web viewing

## Versioning

- Include a version history section at the end of important documents
- Document major changes in the version history
- Include dates and authors for each version

## Maintenance

- Review documentation quarterly
- Update examples to reflect current best practices
- Remove outdated information
- Assign clear ownership for each document

## Accessibility

- Use descriptive headers
- Maintain a logical document structure
- Provide text alternatives for visual content
- Ensure sufficient color contrast

## Technology-Specific Guidelines

### TypeScript Documentation

- Document interfaces and types
- Include JSDoc comments for functions
- Provide usage examples
- Document edge cases and limitations

### React Component Documentation

- Document props with types and descriptions
- Include usage examples
- Document component variants
- Note accessibility considerations

### API Documentation

- Document request and response formats
- Include authentication requirements
- Provide example requests and responses
- Document error codes and handling

By following these standards, we ensure our documentation remains valuable, accessible, and maintainable as our project evolves.
