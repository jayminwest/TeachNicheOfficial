# Test Coverage

This document outlines the test coverage requirements and strategies for the Teach Niche platform, with a focus on ensuring comprehensive testing across all layers of the application.

## Coverage Requirements

### Overall Coverage Targets

| Test Type | Coverage Target | Critical Paths |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Unit Tests | 80% | 100% |
| Integration Tests | 70% | 100% |
| E2E Tests | N/A (flow-based) | 100% |

### Critical Paths

Critical paths must have 100% test coverage across all test types:

1. **User Authentication**
   - Registration
   - Login
   - Password reset
   - Account management

2. **Content Access**
   - Lesson browsing
   - Lesson viewing
   - Content search

3. **Payments**
   - Checkout process
   - Payment processing
   - Receipt generation
   - Refund handling

4. **Instructor Operations**
   - Content upload
   - Content management
   - Analytics viewing
   - Payout processing

## Coverage Measurement

### Code Coverage Tools

- **Unit & Integration**: Jest coverage reports
- **E2E**: Playwright coverage via CodeCoverage API

### Coverage Commands

```bash
# Unit and integration test coverage
npm run test:coverage

# E2E test coverage
npm run test:e2e:coverage

# Combined coverage report
npm run test:coverage:all
```

### Coverage Configuration

```javascript
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  collectCoverage: true,
  coverageDirectory: 'coverage',
  coverageReporters: ['text', 'lcov', 'html'],
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      statements: 80,
      branches: 80,
      functions: 80,
      lines: 80,
    },
    './app/services/auth/': {
      statements: 100,
      branches: 100,
      functions: 100,
      lines: 100,
    },
    './app/services/payments/': {
      statements: 100,
      branches: 100,
      functions: 100,
      lines: 100,
    },
  },
};
```

## Playwright Coverage Strategy

### User Journey Coverage

Playwright tests should cover complete user journeys, including:

1. **New User Journey**
   - Visit homepage
   - Sign up
   - Browse lessons
   - Purchase a lesson
   - Watch content
   - Leave a rating

2. **Instructor Journey**
   - Sign in
   - Create new lesson
   - Upload video content
   - Set pricing
   - Publish lesson
   - View analytics

3. **Admin Journey**
   - Manage users
   - Review content
   - Process refunds
   - Generate reports

### E2E Test Matrix

| Feature Area | User Role | Test Count | Status |
|--------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| Authentication | All | 8 | ✅ |
| Lesson Browsing | Student | 5 | ✅ |
| Lesson Viewing | Student | 6 | ✅ |
| Lesson Purchase | Student | 7 | ✅ |
| Content Creation | Instructor | 10 | ✅ |
| Analytics | Instructor | 4 | ✅ |
| User Management | Admin | 6 | ⚠️ |
| Payment Processing | System | 8 | ✅ |

## Coverage Gaps and Remediation

### Identified Coverage Gaps

1. **Error Handling**
   - Network error scenarios
   - API failure responses
   - Form validation errors

2. **Edge Cases**
   - Large file uploads
   - Concurrent operations
   - Browser compatibility edge cases

3. **Internationalization**
   - Multi-language support
   - Regional payment methods
   - Date/time formatting

### Gap Remediation Plan

1. **Short-term Actions**
   - Add error simulation tests
   - Implement boundary tests for inputs
   - Add cross-browser tests for critical flows

2. **Medium-term Actions**
   - Implement property-based testing for complex inputs
   - Add performance testing for high-load scenarios
   - Expand device coverage matrix

3. **Long-term Actions**
   - Implement chaos testing
   - Add security penetration tests
   - Implement continuous monitoring tests

## Visual Coverage

### Visual Testing Strategy

Playwright enables comprehensive visual testing:

```typescript
// Example visual regression test
test('lesson page visual appearance', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/lessons/lesson-1');
  
  // Take screenshot of specific component
  await expect(page.locator('.lesson-header')).toHaveScreenshot('lesson-header.png');
  
  // Take screenshot of entire page
  await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('lesson-page.png');
});
```

### Visual Coverage Matrix

| Page | Viewport Sizes | Themes | Status |
|------|---------------|--------|--------|
| Home | 3 | Light/Dark | ✅ |
| Lesson Details | 3 | Light/Dark | ✅ |
| Checkout | 3 | Light/Dark | ✅ |
| Dashboard | 3 | Light/Dark | ⚠️ |
| Profile | 3 | Light/Dark | ✅ |

## Accessibility Coverage

### Accessibility Testing with Playwright

```typescript
// Example accessibility test
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import AxeBuilder from '@axe-core/playwright';

test('homepage should not have accessibility violations', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  
  const accessibilityScanResults = await new AxeBuilder({ page }).analyze();
  
  expect(accessibilityScanResults.violations).toEqual([]);
});
```

### Accessibility Coverage Matrix

| Page | WCAG Level | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| Home | AA | ✅ |
| Lesson Details | AA | ✅ |
| Checkout | AA | ⚠️ |
| Dashboard | AA | ⚠️ |
| Profile | AA | ✅ |

## Mobile Coverage

### Mobile Testing Strategy

Playwright enables testing across device emulations:

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
import { devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default {
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'Mobile Chrome',
      use: { ...devices['Pixel 5'] },
    },
    {
      name: 'Mobile Safari',
      use: { ...devices['iPhone 12'] },
    },
    {
      name: 'Desktop Chrome',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
    },
  ],
};
```

### Mobile Coverage Matrix

| Feature | Android | iOS | Status |
|---------|---------|-----|--------|
| Authentication | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ |
| Lesson Browsing | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ |
| Lesson Viewing | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ |
| Checkout | ✓ | ✓ | ⚠️ |
| Profile Management | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ |

## Performance Coverage

### Performance Metrics

Playwright can measure key performance metrics:

```typescript
// Example performance test
test('page load performance', async ({ page }) => {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  
  await page.goto('/lessons');
  
  const metrics = await page.evaluate(() => JSON.stringify(performance.getEntriesByType('navigation')));
  const navigationTiming = JSON.parse(metrics)[0];
  
  expect(navigationTiming.domContentLoadedEventEnd).toBeLessThan(1000);
  expect(navigationTiming.loadEventEnd).toBeLessThan(3000);
});
```

### Performance Coverage Matrix

| Page | Time to Interactive | First Contentful Paint | Status |
|------|---------------------|------------------------|--------|
| Home | < 2s | < 1s | ✅ |
| Lesson Details | < 2s | < 1s | ✅ |
| Checkout | < 2s | < 1s | ⚠️ |
| Dashboard | < 3s | < 1s | ⚠️ |
| Video Player | < 3s | < 1.5s | ✅ |

## Coverage Reporting

### Integrated Coverage Dashboard

We maintain an integrated coverage dashboard that combines:

1. **Code Coverage**: From Jest and Playwright
2. **User Journey Coverage**: From E2E tests
3. **Visual Coverage**: From screenshot tests
4. **Accessibility Coverage**: From axe-core scans
5. **Performance Coverage**: From performance metrics

### Coverage Badges

```markdown
![Unit Test Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/unit--coverage-87%25-brightgreen)
![Integration Test Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/integration--coverage-76%25-yellowgreen)
![E2E Test Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/e2e--coverage-92%25-brightgreen)
```

### Coverage Reports in CI

Our CI pipeline generates and archives coverage reports:

```yaml
- name: Generate coverage report
  run: npm run test:coverage:all
  
- name: Upload coverage report
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: coverage-report
    path: coverage/
```

## Continuous Improvement

### Coverage Review Process

1. Weekly review of coverage metrics
2. Identification of coverage gaps
3. Prioritization of test additions
4. Implementation of new tests
5. Verification of coverage improvement

### Coverage Goals

| Quarter | Unit | Integration | E2E Journeys | Accessibility |
|---------|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| Q1 2025 | 80% | 70% | 85% | 90% |
| Q2 2025 | 85% | 75% | 90% | 95% |
| Q3 2025 | 90% | 80% | 95% | 100% |
| Q4 2025 | 95% | 85% | 100% | 100% |

This document serves as a guide for maintaining and improving test coverage across the Teach Niche platform. Regular reviews and updates to this strategy are essential to ensure comprehensive test coverage as the application evolves.
