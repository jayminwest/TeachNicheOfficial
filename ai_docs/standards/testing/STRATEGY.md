# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Teach Niche platform, providing guidance on what, when, and how to test.

## Testing Principles

1. **Test Early, Test Often**: Testing should begin as early as possible in the development process.
2. **Test Automation**: Prioritize automated tests over manual testing where possible.
3. **Test Coverage**: Aim for comprehensive coverage of critical paths and edge cases.
4. **Test Independence**: Tests should be independent and not rely on other tests.
5. **Test Readability**: Tests should be clear, concise, and easy to understand.

## Testing Pyramid

Our testing approach follows the testing pyramid model:

```
    /\
   /  \
  /    \
 / E2E  \
/--------\
/ Integr. \
/----------\
/   Unit    \
/------------\
```

### Unit Tests (Base Layer)

- **Purpose**: Verify individual functions, methods, and components in isolation
- **Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage minimum
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Responsibility**: Developers
- **When**: Written alongside or before code implementation

### Integration Tests (Middle Layer)

- **Purpose**: Verify interactions between components and services
- **Coverage Target**: All critical user flows
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library, Supertest
- **Responsibility**: Developers
- **When**: After unit tests pass, before feature completion

### End-to-End Tests (Top Layer)

- **Purpose**: Verify complete user journeys across the entire application
- **Coverage Target**: Core user journeys and critical business flows
- **Tools**: Playwright
- **Responsibility**: QA Engineers with Developer support
- **When**: After feature implementation, before release

## Playwright for End-to-End Testing

Playwright is our primary tool for end-to-end testing, chosen for its:

- **Cross-browser support**: Tests run on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- **Reliable automation**: Auto-wait capabilities reduce flakiness
- **Modern architecture**: Works with modern web features and frameworks
- **Performance**: Parallel test execution and isolation
- **Developer experience**: Debugging tools and trace viewer

### Key Playwright Features We Use

1. **Auto-waiting**: Playwright automatically waits for elements to be actionable
2. **Network interception**: Mocking API responses for consistent test environments
3. **Visual comparisons**: Screenshot testing for UI verification
4. **Authentication state**: Reuse authentication state between tests
5. **Tracing**: Detailed recordings of test execution for debugging
6. **Test generators**: Record interactions to generate test code
7. **Mobile emulation**: Test responsive design across device profiles

### Playwright Test Structure

```typescript
// Example Playwright test
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { LoginPage } from '../models/LoginPage';

test.describe('Authentication flows', () => {
  test('should allow user to sign in', async ({ page }) => {
    const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
    await loginPage.goto();
    await loginPage.login('test-user@example.com', 'password123');
    
    // Verify successful login
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="user-avatar"]')).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

## Test Types

### Functional Testing

- Unit tests for individual components and functions
- Integration tests for component interactions
- API tests for backend endpoints
- End-to-end tests for complete user flows

### Non-Functional Testing

- **Performance Testing**: Response time, throughput, resource usage
- **Accessibility Testing**: WCAG compliance with Playwright and axe-core
- **Security Testing**: Vulnerability scanning, penetration testing
- **Usability Testing**: User experience evaluation
- **Compatibility Testing**: Browser and device compatibility via Playwright

## Test Organization

### Directory Structure
```
app/
├── __tests__/           # App-wide tests
├── components/
│   └── ui/
│       └── __tests__/  # Component tests
└── features/
    └── __tests__/      # Feature tests

e2e-tests/               # Playwright tests
├── fixtures/           # Test data and fixtures
├── models/             # Page object models
├── specs/              # Test specifications
└── utils/              # Test utilities
```

### File Naming
- Unit tests: `*.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `*.integration.test.ts`
- E2E tests: `*.spec.ts` (in e2e-tests directory)

## Coverage Requirements

### Minimum Coverage
```typescript
const coverageThresholds = {
  statements: 80,
  branches: 80,
  functions: 80,
  lines: 80,
  
  // Critical paths
  critical: {
    statements: 100,
    branches: 100,
    functions: 100,
    lines: 100
  }
};
```

## Testing Utilities

### 1. Component Testing
```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';

// Example test
describe('Component', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    render(<Component />);
    expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### 2. API Testing
```typescript
import { createMocks } from 'node-mocks-http';

describe('API', () => {
  it('handles successful requests', async () => {
    const { req, res } = createMocks({
      method: 'POST',
      body: { data: 'test' }
    });
    
    await handler(req, res);
    expect(res._getStatusCode()).toBe(200);
  });

  it('handles errors appropriately', async () => {
    const { req, res } = createMocks({
      method: 'POST',
      body: { data: 'invalid' }
    });
    
    await handler(req, res);
    
    expect(res._getStatusCode()).toBe(400);
    expect(JSON.parse(res._getData())).toEqual({
      error: {
        code: expect.any(String),
        message: expect.any(String)
      }
    });
  });
});
```

### 3. Playwright E2E Testing
```typescript
// Example Playwright test for lesson purchase
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { LessonPage } from '../models/LessonPage';
import { CheckoutPage } from '../models/CheckoutPage';

test('user can purchase a lesson', async ({ page }) => {
  // Login first
  await page.goto('/');
  await page.click('[data-testid="sign-in-button"]');
  await page.fill('[data-testid="email-input"]', 'test-buyer@example.com');
  await page.fill('[data-testid="password-input"]', 'TestPassword123!');
  await page.click('[data-testid="submit-sign-in"]');
  await page.waitForSelector('[data-testid="user-avatar"]');
  
  // Navigate to lesson
  const lessonPage = new LessonPage(page);
  await lessonPage.goto('lesson-1');
  
  // Purchase the lesson
  await lessonPage.clickPurchaseButton();
  
  // Complete checkout
  const checkoutPage = new CheckoutPage(page);
  await checkoutPage.fillPaymentDetails({
    cardNumber: '4242424242424242',
    expiry: '12/30',
    cvc: '123'
  });
  await checkoutPage.submitPayment();
  
  // Verify success
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="purchase-success"]')).toBeVisible();
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="video-player"]')).toBeVisible();
});
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Structure
- Arrange: Set up test data
- Act: Execute test action
- Assert: Verify results

### 2. Naming Conventions
```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  describe('behavior', () => {
    it('should do something when condition', () => {
      // Test
    });
  });
});
```

### 3. Mocking
- Mock external services
- Use consistent mock data
- Reset mocks between tests
- Document mock behavior

### 4. Error Testing
- Test error conditions
- Verify error handling
- Test edge cases
- Test validation

### 5. Playwright-Specific Best Practices
- Use Page Object Model pattern
- Leverage test fixtures for common setup
- Use data-testid attributes for stable selectors
- Implement authentication helpers to avoid repetitive login steps
- Use trace viewer for debugging failed tests

## Test Environment Strategy

| Environment | Purpose | Data | Refresh Cycle |
|-------------|---------|------|--------------|
| Local | Development and unit testing | Mock/seed data | On demand |
| CI | Automated test runs | Fresh test data | Every run |
| Dev | Integration testing | Anonymized production-like data | Weekly |
| Staging | Pre-release validation | Production clone | Before releases |
| Production | Live monitoring | Real data | N/A |

## Test Data Management

- Use factories and fixtures for test data generation
- Avoid hardcoded test data
- Maintain seed data for consistent testing
- Use data builders for complex test scenarios
- Leverage Playwright fixtures for E2E test data

## Quality Gates

### Development Gate
- All unit tests pass
- Coverage meets thresholds
- No TypeScript errors
- Linting passes

### Integration Gate
- Integration tests pass
- E2E critical paths pass
- Performance metrics met
- Security checks pass

### Production Gate

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions
```yaml
test:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Run unit and integration tests
      run: npm test
    - name: Install Playwright browsers
      run: npx playwright install --with-deps
    - name: Run Playwright tests
      run: npx playwright test
    - name: Upload test results
      if: always()
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: playwright-report
        path: playwright-report/
    - name: Upload coverage
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v2
```

## Continuous Testing

- Unit and integration tests run on every commit
- End-to-end tests run nightly and before releases
- Performance tests run weekly

## Test Documentation

- Test plans for major features
- Test cases documented in code
- Test results reported and tracked
- Test coverage reports generated automatically
- Playwright trace files preserved for failed tests

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| Developers | Write and maintain unit and integration tests |
| QA Engineers | Design test plans, write E2E tests with Playwright, exploratory testing |
| DevOps | Maintain test infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline |
| Product Managers | Define acceptance criteria and validate test coverage |

## Defect Management

- All defects tracked in issue tracker
- Defects categorized by severity and priority
- Critical defects block releases
- Regression tests added for fixed defects
- Playwright tests added for reproducible bugs

## Continuous Improvement

- Regular review of test effectiveness
- Test retrospectives after releases
- Monitoring of test metrics (coverage, execution time, flakiness)
- Periodic updates to testing strategy based on project needs
- Regular updates to Playwright test suite as new features are added

This testing strategy should be reviewed and updated quarterly to ensure it remains effective and aligned with project goals.
