# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Teach Niche platform, providing guidance on what, when, and how to test.

## Testing Principles

1. **Test Early, Test Often**: Testing should begin as early as possible in the development process.
2. **Test Automation**: Prioritize automated tests over manual testing where possible.
3. **Test Coverage**: Aim for comprehensive coverage of critical paths and edge cases.
4. **Test Independence**: Tests should be independent and not rely on other tests.
5. **Test Readability**: Tests should be clear, concise, and easy to understand.

## Testing Pyramid

Our testing approach follows the testing pyramid model:

```
    /\
   /  \
  /    \
 / E2E  \
/--------\
/ Integr. \
/----------\
/   Unit    \
/------------\
```

### Unit Tests (Base Layer)

- **Purpose**: Verify individual functions, methods, and components in isolation
- **Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage minimum
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Responsibility**: Developers
- **When**: Written alongside or before code implementation

### Integration Tests (Middle Layer)

- **Purpose**: Verify interactions between components and services
- **Coverage Target**: All critical user flows
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library, Supertest
- **Responsibility**: Developers
- **When**: After unit tests pass, before feature completion

### End-to-End Tests (Top Layer)

- **Purpose**: Verify complete user journeys across the entire application
- **Coverage Target**: Core user journeys and critical business flows
- **Tools**: Cypress, Playwright
- **Responsibility**: QA Engineers with Developer support
- **When**: After feature implementation, before release

## Test Types

### Functional Testing

- Unit tests for individual components and functions
- Integration tests for component interactions
- API tests for backend endpoints
- End-to-end tests for complete user flows

### Non-Functional Testing

- **Performance Testing**: Response time, throughput, resource usage
- **Accessibility Testing**: WCAG compliance
- **Security Testing**: Vulnerability scanning, penetration testing
- **Usability Testing**: User experience evaluation
- **Compatibility Testing**: Browser and device compatibility

## Test Organization

### Directory Structure
```
app/
├── __tests__/           # App-wide tests
├── components/
│   └── ui/
│       └── __tests__/  # Component tests
└── features/
    └── __tests__/      # Feature tests
```

### File Naming
- Unit tests: `*.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `*.integration.test.ts`
- E2E tests: `*.e2e.test.ts`

## Coverage Requirements

### Minimum Coverage
```typescript
const coverageThresholds = {
  statements: 80,
  branches: 80,
  functions: 80,
  lines: 80,
  
  // Critical paths
  critical: {
    statements: 100,
    branches: 100,
    functions: 100,
    lines: 100
  }
};
```

## Testing Utilities

### 1. Component Testing
```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';

// Example test
describe('Component', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    render(<Component />);
    expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### 2. API Testing
```typescript
import { createMocks } from 'node-mocks-http';

describe('API', () => {
  it('handles successful requests', async () => {
    const { req, res } = createMocks({
      method: 'POST',
      body: { data: 'test' }
    });
    
    await handler(req, res);
    expect(res._getStatusCode()).toBe(200);
  });

  it('handles errors appropriately', async () => {
    const { req, res } = createMocks({
      method: 'POST',
      body: { data: 'invalid' }
    });
    
    await handler(req, res);
    
    expect(res._getStatusCode()).toBe(400);
    expect(JSON.parse(res._getData())).toEqual({
      error: {
        code: expect.any(String),
        message: expect.any(String)
      }
    });
  });
});
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Structure
- Arrange: Set up test data
- Act: Execute test action
- Assert: Verify results

### 2. Naming Conventions
```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  describe('behavior', () => {
    it('should do something when condition', () => {
      // Test
    });
  });
});
```

### 3. Mocking
- Mock external services
- Use consistent mock data
- Reset mocks between tests
- Document mock behavior

### 4. Error Testing
- Test error conditions
- Verify error handling
- Test edge cases
- Test validation

## Test Environment Strategy

| Environment | Purpose | Data | Refresh Cycle |
|-------------|---------|------|--------------|
| Local | Development and unit testing | Mock/seed data | On demand |
| CI | Automated test runs | Fresh test data | Every run |
| Dev | Integration testing | Anonymized production-like data | Weekly |
| Staging | Pre-release validation | Production clone | Before releases |
| Production | Live monitoring | Real data | N/A |

## Test Data Management

- Use factories and fixtures for test data generation
- Avoid hardcoded test data
- Maintain seed data for consistent testing
- Use data builders for complex test scenarios

## Quality Gates

### Development Gate
- All unit tests pass
- Coverage meets thresholds
- No TypeScript errors
- Linting passes

### Integration Gate
- Integration tests pass
- E2E critical paths pass
- Performance metrics met
- Security checks pass

### Production Gate
- All tests pass
- Full E2E suite passes
- Load testing passes
- Security scan clean

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions
```yaml
test:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
    - name: Upload coverage
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v2
```

## Continuous Testing

- All tests run on every pull request
- Unit and integration tests run on every commit
- End-to-end tests run nightly and before releases
- Performance tests run weekly

## Test Documentation

- Test plans for major features
- Test cases documented in code
- Test results reported and tracked
- Test coverage reports generated automatically

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| Developers | Write and maintain unit and integration tests |
| QA Engineers | Design test plans, write E2E tests, exploratory testing |
| DevOps | Maintain test infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline |
| Product Managers | Define acceptance criteria and validate test coverage |

## Defect Management

- All defects tracked in issue tracker
- Defects categorized by severity and priority
- Critical defects block releases
- Regression tests added for fixed defects

## Continuous Improvement

- Regular review of test effectiveness
- Test retrospectives after releases
- Monitoring of test metrics (coverage, execution time, flakiness)
- Periodic updates to testing strategy based on project needs

This testing strategy should be reviewed and updated quarterly to ensure it remains effective and aligned with project goals.
