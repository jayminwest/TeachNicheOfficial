# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Teach Niche platform, providing guidance on what, when, and how to test.

## Testing Principles

1. **Test Early, Test Often**: Testing should begin as early as possible in the development process.
2. **Test Automation**: Prioritize automated tests over manual testing where possible.
3. **Test Coverage**: Aim for comprehensive coverage of critical paths and edge cases.
4. **Test Independence**: Tests should be independent and not rely on other tests.
5. **Test Readability**: Tests should be clear, concise, and easy to understand.

## Testing Pyramid

Our testing approach follows the testing pyramid model:

```
    /\
   /  \
  /    \
 / E2E  \
/--------\
/ Integr. \
/----------\
/   Unit    \
/------------\
```

### Unit Tests (Base Layer)

- **Purpose**: Verify individual functions, methods, and components in isolation
- **Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage minimum
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Responsibility**: Developers
- **When**: Written alongside or before code implementation

### Integration Tests (Middle Layer)

- **Purpose**: Verify interactions between components and services
- **Coverage Target**: All critical user flows
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library, Supertest
- **Responsibility**: Developers
- **When**: After unit tests pass, before feature completion

### End-to-End Tests (Top Layer)

- **Purpose**: Verify complete user journeys across the entire application
- **Coverage Target**: Core user journeys and critical business flows
- **Tools**: Cypress, Playwright
- **Responsibility**: QA Engineers with Developer support
- **When**: After feature implementation, before release

## Test Types

### Functional Testing

- Unit tests for individual components and functions
- Integration tests for component interactions
- API tests for backend endpoints
- End-to-end tests for complete user flows

### Non-Functional Testing

- **Performance Testing**: Response time, throughput, resource usage
- **Accessibility Testing**: WCAG compliance
- **Security Testing**: Vulnerability scanning, penetration testing
- **Usability Testing**: User experience evaluation
- **Compatibility Testing**: Browser and device compatibility

## Test Environment Strategy

| Environment | Purpose | Data | Refresh Cycle |
|-------------|---------|------|--------------|
| Local | Development and unit testing | Mock/seed data | On demand |
| CI | Automated test runs | Fresh test data | Every run |
| Dev | Integration testing | Anonymized production-like data | Weekly |
| Staging | Pre-release validation | Production clone | Before releases |
| Production | Live monitoring | Real data | N/A |

## Test Data Management

- Use factories and fixtures for test data generation
- Avoid hardcoded test data
- Maintain seed data for consistent testing
- Use data builders for complex test scenarios

## Continuous Testing

- All tests run on every pull request
- Unit and integration tests run on every commit
- End-to-end tests run nightly and before releases
- Performance tests run weekly

## Test Documentation

- Test plans for major features
- Test cases documented in code
- Test results reported and tracked
- Test coverage reports generated automatically

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| Developers | Write and maintain unit and integration tests |
| QA Engineers | Design test plans, write E2E tests, exploratory testing |
| DevOps | Maintain test infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline |
| Product Managers | Define acceptance criteria and validate test coverage |

## Defect Management

- All defects tracked in issue tracker
- Defects categorized by severity and priority
- Critical defects block releases
- Regression tests added for fixed defects

## Continuous Improvement

- Regular review of test effectiveness
- Test retrospectives after releases
- Monitoring of test metrics (coverage, execution time, flakiness)
- Periodic updates to testing strategy based on project needs

This testing strategy should be reviewed and updated quarterly to ensure it remains effective and aligned with project goals.
