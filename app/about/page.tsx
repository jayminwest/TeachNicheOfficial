            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Hello! I&apos;m Jaymin West, the founder of Teach Niche. I&apos;ve played kendama for over seven years, 
              and in that time, I&apos;ve been fortunate enough to sesh with players from all over the world and 
              have tried to form Teach Niche to fit the values of the kendama community as a whole.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Teach Niche was born from a simple idea: to help kendama players make a living from what they love.
