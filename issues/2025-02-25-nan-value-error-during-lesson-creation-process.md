# Fix: NaN Value Error During Lesson Creation Process

## Description

During the lesson creation process, the following error is occurring:

```
Received NaN for the `value` attribute. If this is expected, cast the value to a string.
```

This error is likely occurring in a form input component where a numeric value is being passed as `NaN` instead of a valid number or string. This causes React to throw a warning and may lead to unexpected behavior in the form.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to the lesson creation form
2. Fill out the form fields
3. Observe the console error: "Received NaN for the `value` attribute"

## Expected Behavior

The form should properly validate numeric inputs and either:
- Prevent NaN values from being assigned to input fields
- Cast NaN values to strings when necessary
- Display appropriate validation errors to the user

## Technical Analysis

This issue is likely occurring in one of the following components:
- `app/components/ui/lesson-form.tsx` - The main form component for lesson creation
- Any numeric input fields (price, duration, etc.) within the form

The root cause is probably one of these scenarios:
1. A calculation resulting in NaN is being directly assigned to an input value
2. An empty or non-numeric string is being converted to a number incorrectly
3. A missing or undefined value is being used in a numeric operation

## Proposed Solution

1. Identify the specific input field causing the error
2. Add proper validation to ensure numeric values are valid before rendering
3. Implement a safeguard function to handle potential NaN values:

```typescript
// Example safeguard function
const safeNumberValue = (value: any): string => {
  if (value === undefined || value === null || Number.isNaN(value)) {
    return ''; // Return empty string instead of NaN
  }
  return String(value); // Cast valid numbers to string
};
```

4. Apply this function to all numeric input values in the form

## Affected Files

- `app/components/ui/lesson-form.tsx` (likely)
- Possibly other form-related components that handle numeric inputs

## Testing Requirements

1. Test the lesson creation form with various inputs:
   - Valid numeric values
   - Empty values
   - Non-numeric text
   - Negative numbers (if applicable)
   - Very large numbers
   - Decimal values

2. Verify no console errors appear during form interaction
3. Ensure form validation works correctly for all input scenarios

## Environment

- Browser: All browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Device: Desktop and mobile
- React version: Latest in the project

## Additional Context

This is a common React warning that occurs when an input with `type="number"` receives a non-numeric value. The fix should ensure proper type handling and validation throughout the form.
